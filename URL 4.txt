fourcheese gnocchi bake  and take a turn on the grill in the  tomato gnocchi kebabs Talk about range In this simple  skillet supper  the gnocchi is cooked in a creamy sauce and paired with  chicken thighs The sauce is a simple mix of broth and cream plus  sundried tomatoes We love using sundried tomatoes for their rich concentrated flavor They taste like supercharged tomatoes and make everything theyre in even more craveable As the gnocchi bubbles along in the sauce it soaks up all of that delicious flavor When youre shopping look for bonein skinon chicken thighs that are on the smaller side

the chicken scraps for a  stirfry You can swap chicken breasts in for the thighs but youll need to reduce the cooking time since they cook much faster After the chicken and gnocchi are out of the oven the chicken gets a quick rest and some grated Parm and a box of baby spinach get stirred in with the gnocchi The hit of green looks great and also makes this a true  onepot meal  no side dish required
