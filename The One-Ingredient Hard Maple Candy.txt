Calibration

Before starting, calibrate your thermometer by boiling water in a pot.
Place the thermometer into the boiling water and note the temperature reading, which should be around 212°F (100°C).

Maple Syrup Candy:

Pour the maple syrup into a large, heavy-bottomed pan.
Heat the maple syrup to 300°F (149°C), which is 88°F (49°C) above the boiling point of water. Be sure to check the boiling water temperature beforehand for accuracy.

Shaping and cooling Maple Syrup Candy

As the syrup heats, prepare your candy molds or line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Once the syrup reaches the desired temperature, remove the pan from heat and quickly pour the mixture into the prepared molds or onto the lined baking sheet.
Allow the candy to harden and cool for about 20 minutes.
Remove the candy from the molds or break it into pieces if you used the baking sheet method.
Share and enjoy your homemade maple syrup candy!
