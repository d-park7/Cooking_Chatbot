Ã—    Saffron Cod and Orzo with Guanciale Chili Oil and Frizzled Leeks OC Seafood    i.redd.it  submitted   days ago  by  BushyEyes  comments share save hide report loading... all  comments sorted by  best top new controversial old random qa live beta Want to add to the discussion Post a comment Create an account â€“ BushyEyes  S     points  points  points    days ago * Â   child Recipe here originally  Saffron Cod and Orzo with Guanciale Chili Oil Frizzled leeks  leek white and light green parts only scrubbed and rinsed Vegetable oil Guanciale chili oil  ounces guanciale bacon or pancetta smalldiced  small shallot peeled and finely diced  clove garlic peeled and minced  teaspoon crushed red pepper plus more to taste Â¼ cup extra virgin olive oil Â¼ cup chili oil â€“ teaspoons maple syrup Pinch of salt if needed Saffron cod and orzo Pinch of saffron lightly crushed  tablespoons hot water  ounce portions of cod  fennel bulb with stalks bulb cored and thinly sliced stalks trimmed and thinly sliced into rounds fronds reserved for garnish  shallot peeled and sliced lengthwise into thin wedges  cloves garlic peeled and minced  tablespoons butter  ounces orzo Â½ cups water or vegetable broth  teaspoon extra virgin olive oil  lemon juiced Â¼ cup loosely packed parsley minced Salt and pepper to taste Prep the leek Before beginning prepare the leek as it takes the most time.
Halve the leek lengthwise and very thinly slice both halves into inch wide slivers.
You may need to separate some of the layers of the leek and slice each layer separately.
If you find bits of dirt deep within the leek dont fret.
You can place all the leek slivers in a sieve and rinse again once more to remove any stubborn flecks of dirt.
Transfer the sliced leek to a paper towellined plate and pat dry to remove any excess water.
Steep the saffron Place the crushed saffron in a small bowl and cover it with  tablespoons of hot water.
Set aside.
Prepare the guanciale chili oil Place the guanciale in a large pot youll use this pot later for the orzo and cod and turn the heat to medium.
Cook turning occasionally for â€“ minutes until the fat renders and the guanciale becomes crispy.
Add the shallot garlic and crushed red pepper and cook for an additional  minutes turning often and adjusting the heat as needed to prevent the garlic from browning.
Once the shallot softens and the garlic takes on a very light golden color spoon the mixture into a bowl.
Scoop out all but a tablespoon of the fat from the pot and add it to the bowl of guanciale.
Pour the extra virgin olive oil chili oil and maple syrup over the guanciale.
Stir vigorously to combine.
Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.
Add more maple syrup chili oil or crushed red pepper depending on your preferences.
The guanciale oil will keep in an airtight jar for up to  days.
Prepare the saffron cod and orzo Pat the cod dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
Return the pot of remaining guanciale fat to medium heat.
Add the sliced fennel bulb and stalks along with the sliced shallot.
Season with salt and cook for â€“ minutes until the fennel begins to soften.
Add the garlic and cook for â€“ minutes until just fragrant.
Melt the butter into the pot and add the orzo.
Stir to coat and cook for â€“ minutes until it begins to lightly toast.
Season with salt.
Pour in the water or broth and bring to a boil for â€“ minutes.
Stir often to lift up any orzo that may have stuck to the bottom.
Reduce heat to low and arrange the cod on top.
Drizzle with  teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil.
Drizzle the steeped saffron mixture all over ensuring that each piece of cod gets a little bit of saffron water.
Cover and simmer over low heat for â€“ minutes or until the cod is opaque and the orzo is tender.
Frizzle the leek Note Use a saucepan that has somewhat high sides.
Generally you want a saucepan thats at least â€“ inches deep.
When you add the leeks to the hot oil the oil will foam up vigorously and you do NOT want it pouring over the edges.
As the cod simmers make the leeks.
In a saucepan pour in  inches of vegetable oil.
Turn the heat to mediumhigh.
Break off a piece of leek and add it to the pot if it bubbles rapidly its ready to fry.
Working in small batches add a handful of the leeks at a time to the oil.
Stir occasionally and fry for â€“ seconds until golden brown.
Remove andâ€“using tongsâ€“transfer to a paper towellined plate.
Continue on until all the leeks are fried.
Pat any excess oil off from the tops of the leeks with a paper towel and season with flaky sea salt.
Set aside.
To serve Spoon the cooked orzo into shallow bowls and place a piece of cod on top.
Arrange the frizzled leeks next to the cod and drizzle with the guanciale chili oil.
Sprinkle a few bits of fennel fronds on top if you remember unlike meâ€¦.
