Ã—    Brown Sugar Ham Glaze OC Recipe    i.redd.it  submitted   days ago  by  pangibear  comments share save hide report loading... all  comments sorted by  best top new controversial old random qa live beta Want to add to the discussion Post a comment Create an account â€“ pangibear  S     points  points  points    days ago Â   children Brown Sugar Ham Glaze For full recipe tips  tricks visit  httpsmaplewoodroad.combrownsugarhamglaze INGREDIENTS  pound precooked ham approximate weight  tablespoons salted butter  cup light brown sugar packed Â¼ cup honey  tablespoon brown mustard Â½ cup pineapple juice Â¼ cup apple juice Â¼ teaspoon cinnamon Â¼ teaspoon ground cloves INSTRUCTIONS Preheat oven to Â°F.
Unwrap the ham and place it in a large baking dish.
I also decided to pour all the juices from the bag in the dish to help keep it juicy.
If you have a spiralcut ham theres nothing else to do.
Otherwise make Â¼â€³ deep cuts in a diamond pattern all over the ham surface this will allow the juices from the brown sugar ham glaze to drip down inside later.
Place in the oven and bake.
A ham will take about  to Â½ hours to cook through.
After  hour check the temperature by inserting a meat thermometer in the thickest part being careful not to touch the bone.
The ham is ready when the internal temperature has reached Â°F.
At about the hour mark start making the brown sugar ham glaze.
Melt butter in a small pan over medium heat.
Once the butter has melted add all the other ingredients and whisk together.
Bring to a simmer whisking occasionally and cook for about  minutes.
Immediately remove from heat and let cool for  to  minutes.
Check the internal temperature of your ham the ham is finished cooking when it has reached Â°F.
When its getting close to that point but has about a half hour left baste half of the brown sugar ham glaze onto the ham.
Fifteen minutes later brush on the remaining ham glaze and let the ham finish cooking until it has reached Â°F.
