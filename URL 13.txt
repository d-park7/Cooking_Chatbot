Enjoy permalink embed save report give award reply – netcode    points  point  points    days ago    child Are the chickpeas whole And when you say pasta cooking water to loosen up the sauce doesnt that actually thicken it and make it adhere better to the pasta I think of loose as opposite to that.
permalink embed save parent report give award reply – BushyEyes  S     points  points  points    days ago    children It does both to an extent.
It will make the pasta glossy and the starch helps the sauce adhere to the pasta but its still water its going to thin out the sauce a bit.
This sauce is quite thick in the pan so the water will loosen it up and as it cooks down for a min or two will adhere the sauce.
