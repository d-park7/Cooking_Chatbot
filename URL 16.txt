Place the thermometer into the boiling water and note the temperature reading which should be around Â°F Â°C.
Maple Syrup Candy Pour the maple syrup into a large heavybottomed pan.
Heat the maple syrup to Â°F Â°C which is Â°F Â°C above the boiling point of water.
Be sure to check the boiling water temperature beforehand for accuracy.
Shaping and cooling Maple Syrup Candy As the syrup heats prepare your candy molds or line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Once the syrup reaches the desired temperature remove the pan from heat and quickly pour the mixture into the prepared molds or onto the lined baking sheet.
Allow the candy to harden and cool for about  minutes.
Remove the candy from the molds or break it into pieces if you used the baking sheet method.

Is there a mistake in the celcius temperatures  Says  degreee  then  degree above boiling water temp.
permalink embed save parent report give award reply â€“ zarunohn    points  points  points    days ago Â   children Yeah they took the Â°F from their farenheight boiling point and converted it to Â°C but its meant to be  degrees over boiling in celcius.
Just a small disparity in converting temperatures permalink embed save parent report give award reply â€“ CaptainFartbox    points  points  points    days ago Â   children Farenheight makes no sense.
permalink embed save parent report give award reply â€“ iamnotazombie    points  points  points    days ago Â   child It makes perfect sense Zero is what happens when you mix alcohol ice and salt into a hellish mixture.

permalink embed save report give award reply â€“ Amsnabs    points  points  points    days ago Â   children I have this memory of being about  years old and reading my favorite light blue colored set of books Little House on the Praire they made candies like this but instead of a mold theyd pour little designs on snow outside.
Ive  always  wanted to do this.
permalink embed save report give award reply â€“ sleepykitten    points  points  points    days ago Â   child I guess when reading those books I missed the boiling part Definitely tried this with just plain raw maple syrup in the snow and was NOT good just a mess permalink embed save parent report give award reply â€“ Amsnabs    points  point  points    days ago Â   children LOL good on you for trying I do think the boiling will make a difference.
I complained that the snow was never ending this year but this post came the very weekend it all melted.

If you have a known good thermometer you dont need to mess with the water at all.
permalink embed save parent report give award reply â€“ euphonix    points  point  points    days ago Â   children If you cook the syrup to a softer candy temperature like maybe the hard ball stage ~Â°F would it make more of a maple taffy type consistency rather than a hard candy I imagine it would but Im not sure if maple syrup behaves differently than regular sugar.
