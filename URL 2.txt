EDT Last modified on Wed  Apr  .
EDT T he comfortingly named hotpot is a very useful recipe to have in your repertoire.
Easy and relatively cheap to make it will bubble away happily in the oven while you get on with something else and needs nothing more to accompany it than some steamed greens or a dollop of pickled red cabbage.
A simple but profound pleasure.
Prep   min Cook   hr Pickle   days optional Serves   – bestend or middleneck lamb or mutton cutlets  see step  g diced lamb or mutton neck fillet or shoulder Flour salt sugar and white or black pepper  to dust  large potatoes  see step   onions  sprigs fresh thyme g butter  plus extra for greasing  bay leaf ml lamb stock  see step  For the pickled red cabbage optional  small red cabbage  tbsp salt ml cider whitewine or pickling vinegar   tbsp black peppercorns  optional  tbsp dried juniper berries  optional  tbsp yellow or brown mustard seeds  optional  bay leaf  optional  tbsp sugar  of any colour  Make the cabbage well in advance If you want to make your own pickled red cabbage to go with the hotpot note youll have to start it a few days ahead trim and shred the cabbage cutting the core into small chunks.
Sprinkle with the salt and set aside for eight hours.
Wash off the salt in cold water then drain and pat dry.
Make the pickling liquor Meanwhile pour the vinegar into a large pan and add some or all of the spices bay leaf and sugar.
Bring to a boil simmer for  minutes then take off the heat and leave to cool.
Pickle the cabbage Pack the cabbage into clean jars I sterilise mine by putting them through a hot dishwasher but if you prefer wash them in hot soapy water and dry them in a low oven then pour the cold pickling liquid on top making sure the cabbage is completely covered.
Seal and leave for at least two days and preferably two weeks.
A word on the meat Traditionally made with mutton my preference hotpot also works well with lamb or hogget and would be good with goat too.
The bones of the cutlets add variety and flavour to the gravy if you have a butcher you can ask for such things choose larger middleneck cuts but substitute g neck fillet or boneless shoulder if you prefer.
Prep the lamb and potatoes Dust all the meat with flour and a good pinch each of salt sugar and ground white or black pepper tossing the pieces so theyre lightly coated.
Peel the potatoes and cut into thin slices – a floury variety such as maris piper king edward desiree Rooster or similar would be ideal but waxier varieties will also work.
Prep the rest and grease a casserole Peel and thinly slice the onions and pick the leaves off the thyme sprigs.
Melt the butter in a microwave or small pan then set aside.
Heat the oven to C C fanFgas  and grease a highsided ovenproof casserole dish ideally one for which you have a lid though you could use foil with oil or extra butter.
Start layering up the pot Arrange about a third of the potatoes in the bottom of the dish and season with salt pepper and a little thyme.
Top with all the seasoned meat tuck the bay leaf in there as well then top with all the sliced onions and season again with a little salt pepper and thyme.
Add stock to cover Pour in the lamb stock adding just enough to come up to the top of the onions but no more.
If you cant find decent lamb stock use beef chicken or even vegetable instead – the meat will add flavour to the gravy as it cooks.
Top with the rest of the spuds Finish the dish by arranging the remaining potatoes on top like overlapping fish scales then season with salt pepper and the rest of the thyme.
Brush the potatoes with the melted butter cover and bake for two hours if using mutton give it half an hour longer.
Remove the cover and bake uncovered for another  minutes until the potatoes on top are golden and crisp then serve with the pickled cabbage if using.
