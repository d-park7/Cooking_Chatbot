Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The Observer Winning dish: leek and mussel chowder.  Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The Observer Nigel Slater's midweek dinner Soup Nigel Slater’s recipe for leek and mussel chowder A classic, hearty, warming, wholesome seafood broth Nigel Slater Tue 11 Apr 2023 07.00 EDT T hinly slice medium 3  leeks  and wash them very thoroughly. Cut 150g of  smoked bacon  into short strips and place in a deep pan with 40g of  butter . Place over a moderate heat and let the bacon cook for a few minutes until the fat turns golden. Turn down the heat and add the leeks, then cover with a lid. Leave to cook for 20 minutes or so, until the leeks are soft and sweet. Check occasionally, so they don’t colour. Have 750g of  mussels  ready, washed and checked, discarding any cracked or broken shells or any that don’t close instantly when tapped on the side of the sink. Put them in a large pot, pour in 100ml of  white vermouth  or  white wine , then cover tightly with a lid and bring to the boil. Cook for a minute or two, then check their progress. If the mussels have opened, remove from the heat. If not, give them a minute or so longer. Remove the mussels from their shells, reserving the cooking liquor and discarding the shells. Sprinkle 2 tbsp of  flour  on the leeks and continue cooking for 2 minutes, then pour in the cooking liquor from the mussels, using a fine sieve to catch any shell or grit. Pour in 250ml of  fish  or  vegetable stock , bring to a boil, then stir 250ml of  single cream  into the pot and bring back to the boil, seasoning it with salt (you may only need a little) and black pepper. Chop a generous handful of  parsley  and stir in. Add the mussels and ladle into bowls.  Enough for 4  You can add water in place of the stock. There is already plenty of flavour from the mussel’s cooking liquor.  I sometimes make this a little more substantial by toasting slices of  baguette  and putting them in the bowl before ladling over the soup.

 10 Pieces of Cookware Ina Garten Always Uses 

 10 Images 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Ina Garten  knows the secret to our hearts: dinner that’s easy to make, doesn’t leave a big mess, and will even make our kids happy! Not to mention, it tastes divine (it  is  an  Ina Garten recipe , after all!). The Barefoot Contessa just shared the weeknight  chicken  recipe of our dreams, and we already wrote it on the menu this week.



	 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	In a video posted to Food Network’s YouTube channel yesterday, Garten walks audiences through how to make her delicious  Skillet Roasted Lemon Chicken . 

 

	“It is so easy to make. I love it,” Garten gushes in the video about this recipe. She also explains, “When you cook the chicken, it actually makes its own sauce with lemon and onions. It’s delicious.” We love a chicken that makes its own sauce! 



 

 

	Garten went on, “You don’t even need to serve it on a platter. I just take the entire skillet and put it on the buffet, and everybody helps themselves.” It doesn’t get better than that. 

 

 

 

 

	To make this recipe, you’ll start with an herb oil made with thyme and other ingredients, ground together. It’s mixed with olive oil to create an easy marinade for the chicken. 

 

	Ingredients for the chicken skillet include lemons, garlic, onions, and more, prepared on the skillet before putting the chicken on. It’s such a juicy, flavorful recipe that can also be prepared in advance and kept in the fridge until you’re ready to cook it. This makes it perfect for when you’re hosting a dinner party or just need a hearty meal during the week. (Picture coming home to this warm chicken dinner after a late-night practice instead of picking up fast food again. So good!)

	Garten serves her delicious chicken right from the pan, which Garten says, “might be my favorite chicken of all time.” With that impressive recommendation — and hardly any dishes to clean after! — you’ll want to make this every week.

In his cookbook “On the Curry Trail: Chasing the Flavor That Seduced the World,” author  Raghavan Iyer  includes this recipe in his chapter on Vietnam, noting that he adapted it  from Andrea Nguyen ’s cookbook “Into the Vietnamese Kitchen.” Get the full experience. Choose your plan Iyer writes that the chosen curry powder reflects the tastes of southern India. He recommends it in recipes throughout his cookbook but also notes that Vietnamese curry powder can be substituted if desired. Read the story: Raghavan Iyer’s final book is a guide through curry’s complex history If you make the dish with the recommended cayenne and black pepper, it will have tongue-tingling heat, so adjust to suit your taste. You can make the paste of lemongrass, ginger and onion in a large mortar and pestle, but a food processor speeds up the process nicely.

Ingredients 3 stalks lemongrass (lower 3 inches of each), coarsely chopped 3 slices (each the size of a quarter) fresh ginger 1 medium yellow onion (8 ounces), coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola 2 tablespoons  Madras curry powder  (see headnote) 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skinless chicken thighs or drumsticks, trimmed of excess fat 14 ounces unsweetened full-fat coconut milk 3/4 teaspoon fine salt 1/2 teaspoon coarsely cracked black peppercorns 1 pound red potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro Sliced baguette, for serving (optional) 1 large lime, cut into wedges Step 1 In a food processor, combine the lemongrass, ginger and onion and pulse until finely ground. Step 2 In a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat the oil until it shimmers. Add the fresh spice paste to the oil and stir-fry until light brown and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the curry powder and cayenne and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add the chicken and cook, stirring until the pieces are coated in the curry spices, 1 to 2 minutes. Advertisement Step 3 Add the coconut milk, salt and pepper and cook, scraping the bottom of the pan, until the mixture comes to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is partially cooked (still very pink in the middle), about 15 minutes. Add the potatoes, cover and continue to simmer until the potatoes are fork-tender and the chicken registers 165 degrees on a thermometer inserted in the thickest part, 10 to 12 minutes. Step 4 Ladle the curry into bowls, garnish with the cilantro and serve hot, with baguette slices, if desired, and wedges of lime on the side for squeezing.

Jump to recipe Save to My Recipes PHOTO: ANDREW BUI; FOOD STYLING: SPENCER RICHARDS We might seem  gnocchi-crazed  here at Delish, but can you blame us? The puffy little potato dumplings get roasty toasty in  sheet-pan burrata Caprese gnocchi , masquerade as mac and cheese in  four-cheese gnocchi bake , and take a turn on the grill in the  tomato gnocchi kebabs . Talk about range! In this simple  skillet supper , the gnocchi is cooked in a creamy sauce and paired with  chicken thighs . The sauce is a simple mix of broth and cream, plus  sun-dried tomatoes . We love using sun-dried tomatoes for their rich, concentrated flavor. They taste like supercharged tomatoes and make everything they’re in even more craveable. As the gnocchi bubbles along in the sauce, it soaks up all of that delicious flavor.  When you’re shopping, look for bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs that are on the smaller side, about five ounces each. Choosing smaller chicken thighs will make sure the meat cooks in the same amount of time as the gnocchi. If you can only find large chicken thighs, cut them down a bit and save the chicken scraps for a  stir-fry . You can swap chicken breasts in for the thighs, but you’ll need to reduce the cooking time since they cook much faster.  After the chicken and gnocchi are out of the oven, the chicken gets a quick rest and some grated Parm and a box of baby spinach get stirred in with the gnocchi. The hit of green looks great and also makes this a true  one-pot meal , no side dish required. Made this?

 Dina Ávila/Eater 

 

 

 

 Rick Martínez did not grow up eating rajas con crema; the first time he tried the dish was about three years ago, as he was researching for his cookbook,  Mi Cocina . “The flavors were familiar, but it was a combination of things that I had never had before,” he says. “And to me it was just so comforting.” 

 What he did grow up eating, and loving, was quiche. His mom had one recipe in her repertoire, likely given to her on an index card by one of her coworkers, that mixed spinach, Swiss cheese, tomatoes, and celery seed. “This is the ’70s and ’80s, so quiches weren’t crazy common, certainly in Texas,” Martínez says, but he and his dad always anticipated quiche night. So when he thought to combine the flavors of rajas con crema with quiche, it felt fated. “It’s something very new and then mashed up with something very old and comforting,” he says. “And so the combination is just sort of ultimate comfort food.” 

 The rajas con crema quiche emphasizes the dish’s creaminess and mellowness, mixing soft baked egg with cream, queso fresco, and sweet, starchy corn. It’s also made even richer by being baked in a deep-dish pie pan (Martínez uses one from  Oxo ). “You’re getting that pop of charred poblano, but everything else is just super rich and creamy and eggy,” he says. There is also, perhaps, a more historical reason these flavors go together; Martínez notes the  French occupation of Mexico  resulted in “quite a lot of French influence, particularly in the central part of the country in Mexico City.” French staples like bechamel sauce and crepes have since found a home in Mexican cuisine.  

 Like any quiche, this one is adaptable depending on what you have. Martínez says if you can find Mexican corn, it’s starchier and more toothsome than its sweeter American counterpart, but either will work fine. Also, if your grocery doesn’t have queso fresco, farmer’s cheese or dollops of ricotta will give you that creamy but fresh texture. Here, Martínez pairs the quiche with a tomatillo vinaigrette, which can be drizzled on top or tossed with a side salad, but the quiche works well with any acidic salsa or side. “It’s going to be good if you have a little something to cleanse the palate,” says Martínez, “and then go back in as if it was your first bite.” 

 

 Rajas con Crema Quiche With Tomatillo-Serrano Vinaigrette Recipe 

 Serves 6-8 

 Ingredients: 

 For the crust: 

 2 teaspoons sugar 1½ teaspoons sea salt 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for surface 5 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 3 tablespoons cold lard or vegetable shortening 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar 5½ tablespoons ice water 

 For the filling and assembly: 

 2 large poblano chilies 2 tablespoons unsalted butter ¼ large white onion, chopped (about ⅓ cup) 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1 large ear of corn, kernels removed or 1 cup frozen corn, thawed and drained 1 tablespoon sea salt 8 large eggs, at room temperature 2 ½ cups whole milk 1 cup crema (Mexican sour cream) or sour cream 4 ounces (¾ cup) crumbed queso fresco or farmers cheese  

 For the tomatillo-serrano vinaigrette: 

 8 ounces tomatillos, husks removed, rinsed and quartered ¼ small white onion, roughly chopped 1-2 serrano chilies, roughly chopped (seeds removed for mild heat) 1 garlic clove, peeled 1 tablespoon light agave syrup or honey 2 teaspoons sea salt ⅓ packed cup cilantro leaves and tender stems ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil romaine or little gem lettuce leaves, for serving 

 Tools: 

 1 (9-inch) deep dish (2-inch deep) pie plate 

 Instructions: 

 For the crust:  

 Step 1:  Pulse the sugar, salt, and 2 cups flour in a food processor until combined. Add the butter and lard and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal with a few pieces of butter and lard visible, about 15 one-second pulses. With the motor running, drizzle in the vinegar and ice water and pulse until the dough is still crumbly but just holds together when squeezed (add 1 teaspoon water at a time if necessary, but be careful not to overwork the dough). 

 Step 2:  Turn out the dough onto a work surface. Knead 1 to 2 times, pressing just to incorporate any shaggy pieces. Flatten into a 6-inch-wide disk. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill for at least 3 hours. 

 Step 3:  Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough to a 15-inch round. Transfer to a 9-inch deep-dish (6-cup) pie plate. Pick up the edges and allow the dough to slump down into the dish, letting the excess dough hang over the edge of the rim. Trim the dough, leaving about a 1-inch overhang. Fold the overhang under; pinch and crimp. Chill 30 minutes. 

 Step 4:  Line the dough with parchment paper or foil, leaving some overhang. Fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until the crust is dry around the edges and just beginning to lightly brown, 25 to 35 minutes. Carefully remove the parchment and weights and reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees. Bake until the crust is set and begins to brown in the center, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool. 

 Do ahead: The dough can be made 3 days ahead; keep chilled, or freeze up to 2 months. The crust can be baked one day ahead; tightly wrap and store at room temperature. 

 For the filling and assembly: 

 Step 1:  Using a gas stove or grill on high heat, char the poblanos directly over the flame, resting the peppers on the grates, until charred on all sides, about 4 minutes per side. Alternatively, arrange a rack directly under the broiler and preheat to high. Char the poblanos on a rimmed baking sheet under the broiler, turning occasionally, until charred on all sides, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a large bowl, wrap tightly with plastic wrap and let steam for 20 minutes. Carefully remove the stems, peel, and seeds from each pepper (use gloves if you have them!). Chop and set aside until ready to use. 

 Step 2:  Heat the butter in a large skillet (preferably cast-iron) over medium and cook onion, garlic, corn, and 1 teaspoon salt, tossing occasionally, until lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the poblanos and cook until any excess liquid evaporates and mixture is dry, about 1 minute. Let cool, about 30 minutes. 

 Step 3:  Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees. Combine the eggs, milk, crema, and 2 teaspoons of the salt in a blender on medium-low speed until completely smooth and homogenous, about 30 seconds. 

 Step 4:  Place the pie plate on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the bottom of crust. Top with the poblano mixture. Pour half of the custard into the crust. Transfer the quiche to the oven, then carefully pour the remaining custard into the crust (adding the rest this way will prevent it from spilling during the quiche’s transfer to the oven). Bake the quiche until its edges are set but its center slightly wobbles, 55 to 75 minutes (it will continue to set after baking). Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for at least 3 hours before slicing.  

 Do ahead: The quiche can be baked 1 day ahead. Tightly wrap and chill. Serve warm or at room temperature alongside greens drizzled with the vinaigrette. 

 For the vinaigrette:  

 Step 1:  Puree the tomatillos, onion, serranos, garlic, agave syrup, and salt in a blender until smooth. Add the cilantro and puree until the cilantro is finely chopped. With the motor running on low speed, drizzle in the oil until emulsified. Taste and season with salt or agave if necessary. To thin the dressing, add a tablespoon or two of water and adjust the seasoning. Makes 2 cups.

 There’s a reason this contemporary spin on the Americano has become an industry darling. 

 

 

 

 

  Content Blocks  

 

 When Michael McIlroy created the  Rome With a View , not a single person had tagged a social media post with  #spritzlife ; “aperitivo” was a word and custom firmly contained within the borders of Italy and its like-minded European and South American brethren; and we were still 15 years away from J. Lo releasing  her very own take  on the breezy, low-ABV, Italian-inspired drinks that would sweep the United States in the late 2010s. Few customers, if any at all, were showing up to bars looking for a riff on the  Americano .  

 “I would regularly get customers at Milk & Honey who would tell me they hated bitter [drinks], so this was my, ‘No you don’t, try this’ response,” says McIlroy. 

 

 

 

 It was 2008, and the cocktail aesthetic at that time was still focused on faithful reinterpretations of pre-Prohibition classics. McIlroy was among this group of “rebirthers,”  as Scott Hocker calls them ; he has the  modern   classics  to prove it. But his interests extended beyond the late 19th century, even if his approach was rooted in the minimalist principles of those early cocktails. He created the Rome With a View—a simple combination of Campari, dry vermouth, lime juice and a tiny measure of simple syrup topped off with soda water—as “ a low-ABV drink that could be easily replicated around the bar community.”

 What is effectively a mashup of a  rickey  (spirit, lime, soda) and the  Americano  (Campari, sweet vermouth, soda) is so tethered to the spirit of pre-dinner Italian drinking that it feels as though it’s been a part of the canon all along. And yet it’s modern enough that, amid the crush of competitors born of the same ethos, it is the contemporary aperitivo drink that I return to most frequently. It does not tire because it was built to deliver. It has the smack of sour candy, the characteristic bite of Campari and the thirst-quenching refreshment of seltzer topped off with a squeeze of fresh lime. It’s the cocktail equivalent of getting hit in the face with sea spray.  

 Aside from being undeniably pleasurable to drink, it is also endlessly permutable.  Case in point: Chip Tyndale’s earthy, autumnal  Seven Hills , Matt Belanger’s “tikified”  Quincentuple Your Money  and—McIlroy’s favorite take on the drink—Dan Greenbaum’s  Second Serve . Even McIlroy has, over the years, riffed on his own drink, culminating with the most recent example: Temple Bar’s Rome Royale, which calls on the same build as the original, but swaps Champagne for soda water. I’ll take one any day of the week.

But is it enough? By  Joe Sevier  and  The Bon Appétit Staff & Contributors April 5, 2023 You probably already have some good egg recipes up your sleeve. (Those flourless, protein-heavy  egg muffins  you make when you need a  healthy breakfast  on the go? Strong move. The boozy but light  eggnog  you make every holiday season? Unrivaled.) But eggs are so satisfying and so versatile—not to mention  so expensive right now —we could all use fresh ideas for how to prepare them so they shine every time we cook with them. So whether you’re in the market for a quiche recipe packed with veggies, a method for actually serving your family’s favorite breakfast (eggs Benedict) to the whole gang at once, or an Indian-inspired take on egg salad, our best egg recipes will be there for you—or,  here  for you. You know what we mean. Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Kaitlin Wayne, Prop Styling by Gerri K. Williams 1/45 Spiced Egg Crepe for One Level up your solo dinner game with this egg recipe. We call it a crepe, but you can also think of it as an omelet—a spice-packed omelet, that is, full of mustard seeds, cumin, and turmeric. View Recipe Ted Cavanaugh 2/45 Jammy Soft-Boiled Eggs Once you get the hang of this easy recipe—the keys are in the timing and the gentle boil—you’ll be adding jammy eggs to everything you make:  salads ,  noodle dishes , and more. View Recipe Photo by Alex Lau, food styling by Chris Morocco 3/45 Grand Aioli Some say that whether or not you can make your own aioli is the mark of a truly good home cook. If you agree but haven’t yet taken it upon yourself to learn, allow this recipe to be your teacher. View Recipe Photo by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Susan Ottaviano  4/45 Silky Steamed Eggs With Mushrooms Although  steamed eggs  have been around—it’s comfort food in Taiwan, for example, and is often served alongside Korean BBQ—we still think of it as one of the more creative egg recipes out there. View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Spencer Richards, Prop Styling by Marina Bevilacqua 5/45 Eggs en Cocotte Think of the French brunch dish eggs en cocotte as all the best bits of  poached eggs —tender egg whites and custardy, barely set egg yolks—with none of the fuss. View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata.  Food Styling by Susan Ottaviano.  Prop Styling by Maeve Sheridan 6/45 Turkish-Style Poached Eggs With Brown Butter Garlic Chips This egg recipe is a  garlic  lover’s dream: Crispy garlic chips lend textural balance to the soft eggs and creamy yogurt, all of which get a lift from a garnish of chopped fresh herbs. View Recipe Photograph by Emma Fishman, food styling by Susan Ottaviano, prop styling by Sophie Strangio  7/45 Blistered Asparagus Frittata This low-waste, no-flip frittata recipe uses one whole bunch of asparagus, tough stalk ends and all. Feel free to swap in whatever ingredients you already have on hand: a  leek  for the red onion, for example, or a shallot in place of the garlic. View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Judy Kim, Prop Styling by Stephanie De Luca 8/45 Egg Bhurji Strata Prepare and refrigerate this Indian-inspired strata in advance to let the stale bread soak up the egg custard mixture. It’s a great do-ahead weekend breakfast recipe or brunch dish. View Recipe Photograph by Victoria Jane, Food Styling by Mieko Takahashi 9/45 Simple Does It Deviled Eggs Some people consider deviled eggs a retro appetizer. We say, they never go out of style. This version doesn’t stray too far from the classic, but finely chopped celery, scallions, and pickle relish add texture. View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Pearl Jones, Prop Styling by Stephanie De Luca 10/45 Make-Ahead Egg and Cheese Sandwiches This is our ideal breakfast sandwich, not only because it contains cheddar cheese and crunchy fried red onions, but also because it can be prepared ahead. And if you’re more of an  egg-in-a-hole  type, we’ve got you there too. View Recipe Photo by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Pearl Jones 11/45 Tomato and Egg Drop Noodle Soup These are not your average breakfast eggs. In fact, this beloved Hong Kong soup, which relies heavily on  pantry staples , is a better fit for when you need a cozy but easy supper. View Recipe Photo by Emma Fishman, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Elizabeth Jaime 12/45 Molletes A mollete, a Mexican-style open-face sandwich with beans and cheese, doesn’t really exist. Because when you sit down to eat one, you can’t; you must have two.  Molletes . View Recipe Photo by Alex Lau, food styling by Pearl Jones 13/45 Carbonara Lasagna A dish that’s equally delicious served with a bottle of  Lambrusco  at night as it is for breakfast the following morning with  cold brew ? We’ll take it. ( If you want a more traditional carbonara, here’s the silkiest version of the classic pasta dish .) View Recipe Photo by Ted Cavanaugh 14/45 Pickled Eggs Pickling eggs in cracked but intact shells creates a unique tie-dye effect on each one. (Just make sure you crack them yourself, no one should be pickling  an egg that’s gone bad .) If you want a more uniform color, try this recipe for  Beet-Pickled Eggs . View Recipe Photo by Emma Fishman 15/45 Khai Jiao Like those pop-up sponges you might remember from childhood, this Thai-style omelet will start to puff as soon as it hits the hot oil. View Recipe Photograph by Yudi Ela Echevarria, food styling by Micah Morton, prop styling by Sean Dooley, Special thanks to Frank's House 16/45 Peppery Potato Frittata We could create an entire gallery devoted to the  frittata , also known as the most delicious way to use leftovers. We have a version with  lamb and feta , another with  mushrooms and leeks , and another with  chickpeas and greens . (And yes, there are more beyond those.) View Recipe Photo by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Emily Eisen 17/45 Chicken Cobb Salad Eggs with medium-set yolks (that’s a seven-minute egg, for those pros out there) make appearances in some of our favorite meal-worthy salads, such as the  tuna Niçoise  and this modified Cobb. View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Micah Morton, Prop Styling by Tim Ferro 18/45 Migas With Green Salsa What makes migas different from scrambled eggs? Crunchy tortilla tips. Migas literally translates to “crumbs,” as the egg recipe is meant to be a way to use up stale tortillas. View Recipe Photograph by Guang Xu 19/45 Creamy Crab and Boursin Omelet If you’ve never had creamy Boursin Garlic and Fine Herbs cheese—do those people exist?—then we suggest you run to the store immediately, and then make this omelet. View Recipe Photo by Laura Murray, food styling by Susie Theodorou 20/45 Golden Fried Rice With Salmon and Furikake Egg yolks are the secret to superb (and golden)  fried rice ; they help the grains maintain their structure and stay separate from one another instead of becoming a mushy mass. View Recipe Photograph by Emma Fishman, food styling by Kendra Vaculin 21/45 Baked Eggs and Greens in Harissa Tomato Sauce Croutons need not be saved exclusively for salads. In this egg recipe, hand-torn hunks of country-style bread, crisped in a skillet, bring crunch while also soaking up tomato sauce and yogurt. View Recipe Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate Buckens 22/45 French Toast Casserole French toast meets breakfast casserole in this hands-off entertaining brunch dish. This recipe is all about creating a  bread pudding  experience balanced by textural pops of demerara sugar. View Recipe Photograph by Laura Murray, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Sophie Strangio 23/45 Simplest Rosti It’s not a  latke . It’s not a  hash brown . It’s a rosti, a Swiss dish consisting of grated potatoes and onions held together by sheer will (and a firm press in a hot skillet). Naturally, we put fried eggs on top. View Recipe Photo by Chelsie Craig,  Food Styling by Yekaterina Boytsova 24/45 Breakfast Burrito to Go We love to keep the filling for this burrito classic with melty cheese, hot sauce, and avocado, but if you want a  New Mexican–style breakfast burrito , we have that too. View Recipe Photographs by Emma Fishman 25/45 Curried Egg Tartines Of course, we had to include an egg salad recipe on the list. If you prefer a more traditional version for your brunch dish, try these  Egg Salad Tartines With Mixed Herbs , but we find ourselves turning to this curry powder-infused recipe again and again—and finishing it with loads of fresh chives. View Recipe Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Pearl Jones 26/45 Steak and Eggs With Salsa Verde Steak and eggs is one of those special dishes you indulge in when it’s most needed, so make it count: Get a nice hard sear on the meat’s exterior and get those olive-oil-fried eggs real crispy on the edges. View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Pearl Jones, Prop Styling by Gözde Eker 27/45 Masala Skillet Scramble Just a little bit of ground cumin, fresh ginger, and finely chopped jalapeño take this one-pan dish in a totally different direction from your average diner-style egg scramble. View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Thu Buser, Prop Styling by Sean Dooley 28/45 Sheet-Pan Merguez Hash With Fried Eggs How will you take your eggs this morning? May we suggest sunny-side up and placed atop a potato and  sausage  hash, please and thank you very much? View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Taneka Morris, Prop Styling by Gerri K. Williams 29/45 Quick and Cheesy Omelet Roll-Up We’re not concerned with whether or not this flour tortilla roll-up would technically be considered an  egg sandwich . We’re just concerned with how delicious and portable it is. View Recipe Photo by Alex Lau, Styling by Sue Li 30/45 Egg White Chalupa This chalupa has many layers: a crispy fried tortilla, stewed black beans, shredded iceberg lettuce, springy egg whites, hot sauce, cheese, fresh cilantro.… Avocado toast could never. View Recipe Alex Lau 31/45 Salad for Breakfast We love this salad for breakfast: jammy eggs, salty feta, crunchy vegetables. If you’re going low-carb, serve it without the crusty bread, but we like to use it to sop up any extra dressing. View Recipe Photo by Laura Murray. Food styling by Judy Mancini 32/45 Cheesy Egg Bake With Sausage When you want breakfast for dinner, make this egg casserole. The recipe is flexible enough to work with whatever veggies you have in the fridge;  winter squash  works in colder months, but zucchini and feta would be a nice summertime version. View Recipe Photo by Chelsie Craig, styling by Judy Mancini 33/45 Eggs Benedict for a Crowd If you’ve ever tried to make classic eggs Benedict for a crowd, you’ll know that it’s, well, challenging. (The hollandaise sauce alone...) And while it’s true that we’ve never heard “eggs Benedict” and “easy breakfast” used in the same sentence, we figured out a way. View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Judy Kim, Prop Styling by Stephanie De Luca 34/45 Bibimbap There is no definitive bibimbap recipe, but the one constant is  rice  topped with an array of garnishes. For us, the other nonnegotiable is a fried egg on top. View Recipe Alex Lau 35/45 BA's Best Quiche Lorraine Buttery, bacon-y, and custardy, quiche Lorraine is an all-time classic. But we also love  this version made with caraway-scented cabbage and leeks . Served with an apple and radish salad, it makes for a great  Easter brunch dish . View Recipe Ted Cavanaugh 36/45 Chorizo Breakfast Tacos With Potato Hash and Fried Eggs We recommend olive-oil-basted fried eggs for topping these tacos: You’ll tilt your skillet toward you so that oil pools at the front edge of the pan, and use a big soup spoon to bathe the egg whites in that oil until they’re set. View Recipe Alex Lau 37/45 Green Shakshuka Shakshuka  typically involves eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, olive oil, peppers, onion, and garlic, but we love a riff. This version is made green by Swiss chard, serrano chiles, and cilantro. (Bonus: Here’s another version made with  butternut squash .) View Recipe Ted Cavanaugh 38/45 Hard-Boiled Eggs Ask a dozen cooks  how to boil eggs  and you’ll get a dozen different answers. This is our method for perfectly hard-boiled eggs—and we’ve got some tips for peeling too (a.k.a. the only thing about eggs we don’t love). View Recipe Marcus Nilsson 39/45 Rigatoni With Lemon-Chile Pesto and Grated Egg Once you finely grate hard-boiled egg yolks for this pasta, you’ll come up with all kinds of ideas for the garnish: Use it as a topping for crostini, soup, or steamed veggies. View Recipe Alex Lau 40/45 Sumac Fried Eggs With Red Chile and Garlic A little sumac brings brightness to these olive-oil-fried eggs. If you’re new to this tart, citrusy spice and want to play with it some more, try these recipes for  Sumac Chicken With Onions and Flatbread  and  Smashed Green Beans With Lemony Sumac Dressing . View Recipe Peden + Munk 41/45 Lentil and Egg Stew Make use of that leftover Parmesan rind with this vegetarian  stew recipe , which can be prepared three days in advance. When you’re ready to eat, finish the dish by poaching eggs right in lentil mixture. View Recipe Jenny Rosenstrach, Andy Ward 42/45 Spanish Tortilla This egg dish begins with potatoes. Slowly cook them along with onions in lots—we mean one and a half cups—of olive oil, then save the leftover oil to make mayonnaise (or whatever else you want, frankly). View Recipe Elizabeth Cecil 43/45 Croque-Madame With Cranberry-Mustard Relish You know how the cheese sometimes oozes out of a  grilled cheese  while it’s cooking? It then gets all golden and crunchy when it hits the skillet? This recipe is dedicated to making that happen on purpose. View Recipe Alex Lau 44/45 Reuben Dutch Baby A Dutch baby is similar to a  large Yorkshire pudding  and can be thought of as an  oven-baked pancake . This version, made with Swiss cheese and pastrami, makes for a hearty breakfast. View Recipe Photo By Zach Desart 45/45 Scotch Eggs This egg recipe isn’t so much a breakfast idea as it is a meaty, salty, crunchy  drinking snack  idea. Scotch eggs, the gastropub staple, are simply meant for a pint of beer.

      Who We Are    

 

Simply Recipes is here to help you cook delicious meals with less stress and more joy. We offer recipes and cooking advice  for home cooks, by home cooks . Helping create “kitchen wins” is what we’re all about.

 

 

 

Simply Recipes was founded in 2003 by Elise Bauer as a home cooking blog to record her favorite family recipes. Today, Simply Recipes has grown into a trusted resource for home cooks with more than 3,000 tested recipes, guides, and meal plans, drawing over 15 million readers each month from around the world. We’re supported by a diverse group of recipe developers, food writers, recipe and product testers, photographers, and other creative professionals.

 

 

      Our History    

 

Elise Bauer was a busy Silicon Valley executive when she became sick with a flu that wouldn’t go away in 2001. In 2003, Elise moved home with her parents and lived with them for several years, recovering from chronic fatigue and documenting her parents’ cooking on Simply Recipes. ( Here’s more of that story .) Over the years, what started as a small blog grew to reach millions of readers every month! In 2020, Simply Recipes was acquired by Dotdash Meredith, a New York-based media company.

 

 

      Recipe Development & Testing    

 

Our recipes primarily use fresh, unprocessed ingredients but we also believe there is a time and a place for canned, frozen, and other prepared ingredients. We believe in a diet that includes a wide variety of foods: real butter and cream, extra virgin olive oil, eggs, lots of fruits and vegetables, and protein from meat, fish, beans, and cheese. Plus cake for dessert.

 

 

 

There are three things we think about when deciding if a recipe is good enough to go on Simply Recipes:

 

 

 

 First, does it work?  Recipes need to be easy to follow and provide reliable results, every time.

 

 

 

 Second, is it delicious?  Does the dish make us smile inside and out? Do we want to eat the whole batch by ourselves? 

 

 

 

 Third, is it worth the effort?  Do we want to make it again (and again and again)?

 

 

 

To make sure each of these standards is met, we start by working with expert recipe developers  — people with the experience and knowledge to not only develop a good recipe in their own kitchens, but to make sure that recipe works in yours. Next, we thoroughly review and edit every recipe in-house line by line. Finally, each new recipe is run by our team of recipe testers working in home kitchens with the same pots, pans, and tools that you use in yours. Only after all this is the recipe shared on Simply Recipes.

 

 

 

Additionally, at Simply Recipes, we aspire to provide the highest quality content produced by humans, for humans. It is against our guidelines to publish automatically generated content using AI (artificial intelligence) writing tools such as ChatGPT.

      Diversity & Inclusion    

 

Everyone is welcome at the Simply Recipes table: people of all races, religions, genders, sexual orientations, ages, backgrounds, and abilities. We strive to be a resource for every home cook, and we consciously work to make this inclusion felt in every part of the site, from the individuals we hire to the recipes we share.

 

 

 

We’re not perfect, but we hope to get more right than we get wrong.  For a full look at our 2023 Diversity & Inclusion commitments and a recap of our commitments and progress from previous years, please see  HERE .

Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The Observer Winning dish: leek and mussel chowder.  Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The Observer Nigel Slater's midweek dinner Soup Nigel Slater’s recipe for leek and mussel chowder A classic, hearty, warming, wholesome seafood broth Nigel Slater Tue 11 Apr 2023 07.00 EDT T hinly slice medium 3  leeks  and wash them very thoroughly. Cut 150g of  smoked bacon  into short strips and place in a deep pan with 40g of  butter . Place over a moderate heat and let the bacon cook for a few minutes until the fat turns golden. Turn down the heat and add the leeks, then cover with a lid. Leave to cook for 20 minutes or so, until the leeks are soft and sweet. Check occasionally, so they don’t colour. Have 750g of  mussels  ready, washed and checked, discarding any cracked or broken shells or any that don’t close instantly when tapped on the side of the sink. Put them in a large pot, pour in 100ml of  white vermouth  or  white wine , then cover tightly with a lid and bring to the boil. Cook for a minute or two, then check their progress. If the mussels have opened, remove from the heat. If not, give them a minute or so longer. Remove the mussels from their shells, reserving the cooking liquor and discarding the shells. Sprinkle 2 tbsp of  flour  on the leeks and continue cooking for 2 minutes, then pour in the cooking liquor from the mussels, using a fine sieve to catch any shell or grit. Pour in 250ml of  fish  or  vegetable stock , bring to a boil, then stir 250ml of  single cream  into the pot and bring back to the boil, seasoning it with salt (you may only need a little) and black pepper. Chop a generous handful of  parsley  and stir in. Add the mussels and ladle into bowls.  Enough for 4  You can add water in place of the stock. There is already plenty of flavour from the mussel’s cooking liquor.  I sometimes make this a little more substantial by toasting slices of  baguette  and putting them in the bowl before ladling over the soup.

 10 Pieces of Cookware Ina Garten Always Uses 

 10 Images 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Ina Garten  knows the secret to our hearts: dinner that’s easy to make, doesn’t leave a big mess, and will even make our kids happy! Not to mention, it tastes divine (it  is  an  Ina Garten recipe , after all!). The Barefoot Contessa just shared the weeknight  chicken  recipe of our dreams, and we already wrote it on the menu this week.



	 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	In a video posted to Food Network’s YouTube channel yesterday, Garten walks audiences through how to make her delicious  Skillet Roasted Lemon Chicken . 

 

	“It is so easy to make. I love it,” Garten gushes in the video about this recipe. She also explains, “When you cook the chicken, it actually makes its own sauce with lemon and onions. It’s delicious.” We love a chicken that makes its own sauce! 



 

 

	Garten went on, “You don’t even need to serve it on a platter. I just take the entire skillet and put it on the buffet, and everybody helps themselves.” It doesn’t get better than that. 

 

 

 

 

	To make this recipe, you’ll start with an herb oil made with thyme and other ingredients, ground together. It’s mixed with olive oil to create an easy marinade for the chicken. 

 

	Ingredients for the chicken skillet include lemons, garlic, onions, and more, prepared on the skillet before putting the chicken on. It’s such a juicy, flavorful recipe that can also be prepared in advance and kept in the fridge until you’re ready to cook it. This makes it perfect for when you’re hosting a dinner party or just need a hearty meal during the week. (Picture coming home to this warm chicken dinner after a late-night practice instead of picking up fast food again. So good!)

	Garten serves her delicious chicken right from the pan, which Garten says, “might be my favorite chicken of all time.” With that impressive recommendation — and hardly any dishes to clean after! — you’ll want to make this every week.

In his cookbook “On the Curry Trail: Chasing the Flavor That Seduced the World,” author  Raghavan Iyer  includes this recipe in his chapter on Vietnam, noting that he adapted it  from Andrea Nguyen ’s cookbook “Into the Vietnamese Kitchen.” Get the full experience. Choose your plan Iyer writes that the chosen curry powder reflects the tastes of southern India. He recommends it in recipes throughout his cookbook but also notes that Vietnamese curry powder can be substituted if desired. Read the story: Raghavan Iyer’s final book is a guide through curry’s complex history If you make the dish with the recommended cayenne and black pepper, it will have tongue-tingling heat, so adjust to suit your taste. You can make the paste of lemongrass, ginger and onion in a large mortar and pestle, but a food processor speeds up the process nicely.

Ingredients 3 stalks lemongrass (lower 3 inches of each), coarsely chopped 3 slices (each the size of a quarter) fresh ginger 1 medium yellow onion (8 ounces), coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola 2 tablespoons  Madras curry powder  (see headnote) 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skinless chicken thighs or drumsticks, trimmed of excess fat 14 ounces unsweetened full-fat coconut milk 3/4 teaspoon fine salt 1/2 teaspoon coarsely cracked black peppercorns 1 pound red potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro Sliced baguette, for serving (optional) 1 large lime, cut into wedges Step 1 In a food processor, combine the lemongrass, ginger and onion and pulse until finely ground. Step 2 In a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat the oil until it shimmers. Add the fresh spice paste to the oil and stir-fry until light brown and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the curry powder and cayenne and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add the chicken and cook, stirring until the pieces are coated in the curry spices, 1 to 2 minutes. Advertisement Step 3 Add the coconut milk, salt and pepper and cook, scraping the bottom of the pan, until the mixture comes to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is partially cooked (still very pink in the middle), about 15 minutes. Add the potatoes, cover and continue to simmer until the potatoes are fork-tender and the chicken registers 165 degrees on a thermometer inserted in the thickest part, 10 to 12 minutes. Step 4 Ladle the curry into bowls, garnish with the cilantro and serve hot, with baguette slices, if desired, and wedges of lime on the side for squeezing.

Jump to recipe Save to My Recipes PHOTO: ANDREW BUI; FOOD STYLING: SPENCER RICHARDS We might seem  gnocchi-crazed  here at Delish, but can you blame us? The puffy little potato dumplings get roasty toasty in  sheet-pan burrata Caprese gnocchi , masquerade as mac and cheese in  four-cheese gnocchi bake , and take a turn on the grill in the  tomato gnocchi kebabs . Talk about range! In this simple  skillet supper , the gnocchi is cooked in a creamy sauce and paired with  chicken thighs . The sauce is a simple mix of broth and cream, plus  sun-dried tomatoes . We love using sun-dried tomatoes for their rich, concentrated flavor. They taste like supercharged tomatoes and make everything they’re in even more craveable. As the gnocchi bubbles along in the sauce, it soaks up all of that delicious flavor.  When you’re shopping, look for bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs that are on the smaller side, about five ounces each. Choosing smaller chicken thighs will make sure the meat cooks in the same amount of time as the gnocchi. If you can only find large chicken thighs, cut them down a bit and save the chicken scraps for a  stir-fry . You can swap chicken breasts in for the thighs, but you’ll need to reduce the cooking time since they cook much faster.  After the chicken and gnocchi are out of the oven, the chicken gets a quick rest and some grated Parm and a box of baby spinach get stirred in with the gnocchi. The hit of green looks great and also makes this a true  one-pot meal , no side dish required. Made this?

 Dina Ávila/Eater 

 

 

 

 Rick Martínez did not grow up eating rajas con crema; the first time he tried the dish was about three years ago, as he was researching for his cookbook,  Mi Cocina . “The flavors were familiar, but it was a combination of things that I had never had before,” he says. “And to me it was just so comforting.” 

 What he did grow up eating, and loving, was quiche. His mom had one recipe in her repertoire, likely given to her on an index card by one of her coworkers, that mixed spinach, Swiss cheese, tomatoes, and celery seed. “This is the ’70s and ’80s, so quiches weren’t crazy common, certainly in Texas,” Martínez says, but he and his dad always anticipated quiche night. So when he thought to combine the flavors of rajas con crema with quiche, it felt fated. “It’s something very new and then mashed up with something very old and comforting,” he says. “And so the combination is just sort of ultimate comfort food.” 

 The rajas con crema quiche emphasizes the dish’s creaminess and mellowness, mixing soft baked egg with cream, queso fresco, and sweet, starchy corn. It’s also made even richer by being baked in a deep-dish pie pan (Martínez uses one from  Oxo ). “You’re getting that pop of charred poblano, but everything else is just super rich and creamy and eggy,” he says. There is also, perhaps, a more historical reason these flavors go together; Martínez notes the  French occupation of Mexico  resulted in “quite a lot of French influence, particularly in the central part of the country in Mexico City.” French staples like bechamel sauce and crepes have since found a home in Mexican cuisine.  

 Like any quiche, this one is adaptable depending on what you have. Martínez says if you can find Mexican corn, it’s starchier and more toothsome than its sweeter American counterpart, but either will work fine. Also, if your grocery doesn’t have queso fresco, farmer’s cheese or dollops of ricotta will give you that creamy but fresh texture. Here, Martínez pairs the quiche with a tomatillo vinaigrette, which can be drizzled on top or tossed with a side salad, but the quiche works well with any acidic salsa or side. “It’s going to be good if you have a little something to cleanse the palate,” says Martínez, “and then go back in as if it was your first bite.” 

 

 Rajas con Crema Quiche With Tomatillo-Serrano Vinaigrette Recipe 

 Serves 6-8 

 Ingredients: 

 For the crust: 

 2 teaspoons sugar 1½ teaspoons sea salt 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for surface 5 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 3 tablespoons cold lard or vegetable shortening 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar 5½ tablespoons ice water 

 For the filling and assembly: 

 2 large poblano chilies 2 tablespoons unsalted butter ¼ large white onion, chopped (about ⅓ cup) 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1 large ear of corn, kernels removed or 1 cup frozen corn, thawed and drained 1 tablespoon sea salt 8 large eggs, at room temperature 2 ½ cups whole milk 1 cup crema (Mexican sour cream) or sour cream 4 ounces (¾ cup) crumbed queso fresco or farmers cheese  

 For the tomatillo-serrano vinaigrette: 

 8 ounces tomatillos, husks removed, rinsed and quartered ¼ small white onion, roughly chopped 1-2 serrano chilies, roughly chopped (seeds removed for mild heat) 1 garlic clove, peeled 1 tablespoon light agave syrup or honey 2 teaspoons sea salt ⅓ packed cup cilantro leaves and tender stems ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil romaine or little gem lettuce leaves, for serving 

 Tools: 

 1 (9-inch) deep dish (2-inch deep) pie plate 

 Instructions: 

 For the crust:  

 Step 1:  Pulse the sugar, salt, and 2 cups flour in a food processor until combined. Add the butter and lard and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal with a few pieces of butter and lard visible, about 15 one-second pulses. With the motor running, drizzle in the vinegar and ice water and pulse until the dough is still crumbly but just holds together when squeezed (add 1 teaspoon water at a time if necessary, but be careful not to overwork the dough). 

 Step 2:  Turn out the dough onto a work surface. Knead 1 to 2 times, pressing just to incorporate any shaggy pieces. Flatten into a 6-inch-wide disk. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill for at least 3 hours. 

 Step 3:  Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough to a 15-inch round. Transfer to a 9-inch deep-dish (6-cup) pie plate. Pick up the edges and allow the dough to slump down into the dish, letting the excess dough hang over the edge of the rim. Trim the dough, leaving about a 1-inch overhang. Fold the overhang under; pinch and crimp. Chill 30 minutes. 

 Step 4:  Line the dough with parchment paper or foil, leaving some overhang. Fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until the crust is dry around the edges and just beginning to lightly brown, 25 to 35 minutes. Carefully remove the parchment and weights and reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees. Bake until the crust is set and begins to brown in the center, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool. 

 Do ahead: The dough can be made 3 days ahead; keep chilled, or freeze up to 2 months. The crust can be baked one day ahead; tightly wrap and store at room temperature. 

 For the filling and assembly: 

 Step 1:  Using a gas stove or grill on high heat, char the poblanos directly over the flame, resting the peppers on the grates, until charred on all sides, about 4 minutes per side. Alternatively, arrange a rack directly under the broiler and preheat to high. Char the poblanos on a rimmed baking sheet under the broiler, turning occasionally, until charred on all sides, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a large bowl, wrap tightly with plastic wrap and let steam for 20 minutes. Carefully remove the stems, peel, and seeds from each pepper (use gloves if you have them!). Chop and set aside until ready to use. 

 Step 2:  Heat the butter in a large skillet (preferably cast-iron) over medium and cook onion, garlic, corn, and 1 teaspoon salt, tossing occasionally, until lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the poblanos and cook until any excess liquid evaporates and mixture is dry, about 1 minute. Let cool, about 30 minutes. 

 Step 3:  Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees. Combine the eggs, milk, crema, and 2 teaspoons of the salt in a blender on medium-low speed until completely smooth and homogenous, about 30 seconds. 

 Step 4:  Place the pie plate on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the bottom of crust. Top with the poblano mixture. Pour half of the custard into the crust. Transfer the quiche to the oven, then carefully pour the remaining custard into the crust (adding the rest this way will prevent it from spilling during the quiche’s transfer to the oven). Bake the quiche until its edges are set but its center slightly wobbles, 55 to 75 minutes (it will continue to set after baking). Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for at least 3 hours before slicing.  

 Do ahead: The quiche can be baked 1 day ahead. Tightly wrap and chill. Serve warm or at room temperature alongside greens drizzled with the vinaigrette. 

 For the vinaigrette:  

 Step 1:  Puree the tomatillos, onion, serranos, garlic, agave syrup, and salt in a blender until smooth. Add the cilantro and puree until the cilantro is finely chopped. With the motor running on low speed, drizzle in the oil until emulsified. Taste and season with salt or agave if necessary. To thin the dressing, add a tablespoon or two of water and adjust the seasoning. Makes 2 cups.

 There’s a reason this contemporary spin on the Americano has become an industry darling. 

 

 

 

 

  Content Blocks  

 

 When Michael McIlroy created the  Rome With a View , not a single person had tagged a social media post with  #spritzlife ; “aperitivo” was a word and custom firmly contained within the borders of Italy and its like-minded European and South American brethren; and we were still 15 years away from J. Lo releasing  her very own take  on the breezy, low-ABV, Italian-inspired drinks that would sweep the United States in the late 2010s. Few customers, if any at all, were showing up to bars looking for a riff on the  Americano .  

 “I would regularly get customers at Milk & Honey who would tell me they hated bitter [drinks], so this was my, ‘No you don’t, try this’ response,” says McIlroy. 

 

 

 

 It was 2008, and the cocktail aesthetic at that time was still focused on faithful reinterpretations of pre-Prohibition classics. McIlroy was among this group of “rebirthers,”  as Scott Hocker calls them ; he has the  modern   classics  to prove it. But his interests extended beyond the late 19th century, even if his approach was rooted in the minimalist principles of those early cocktails. He created the Rome With a View—a simple combination of Campari, dry vermouth, lime juice and a tiny measure of simple syrup topped off with soda water—as “ a low-ABV drink that could be easily replicated around the bar community.”

 What is effectively a mashup of a  rickey  (spirit, lime, soda) and the  Americano  (Campari, sweet vermouth, soda) is so tethered to the spirit of pre-dinner Italian drinking that it feels as though it’s been a part of the canon all along. And yet it’s modern enough that, amid the crush of competitors born of the same ethos, it is the contemporary aperitivo drink that I return to most frequently. It does not tire because it was built to deliver. It has the smack of sour candy, the characteristic bite of Campari and the thirst-quenching refreshment of seltzer topped off with a squeeze of fresh lime. It’s the cocktail equivalent of getting hit in the face with sea spray.  

 Aside from being undeniably pleasurable to drink, it is also endlessly permutable.  Case in point: Chip Tyndale’s earthy, autumnal  Seven Hills , Matt Belanger’s “tikified”  Quincentuple Your Money  and—McIlroy’s favorite take on the drink—Dan Greenbaum’s  Second Serve . Even McIlroy has, over the years, riffed on his own drink, culminating with the most recent example: Temple Bar’s Rome Royale, which calls on the same build as the original, but swaps Champagne for soda water. I’ll take one any day of the week.

But is it enough? By  Joe Sevier  and  The Bon Appétit Staff & Contributors April 5, 2023 You probably already have some good egg recipes up your sleeve. (Those flourless, protein-heavy  egg muffins  you make when you need a  healthy breakfast  on the go? Strong move. The boozy but light  eggnog  you make every holiday season? Unrivaled.) But eggs are so satisfying and so versatile—not to mention  so expensive right now —we could all use fresh ideas for how to prepare them so they shine every time we cook with them. So whether you’re in the market for a quiche recipe packed with veggies, a method for actually serving your family’s favorite breakfast (eggs Benedict) to the whole gang at once, or an Indian-inspired take on egg salad, our best egg recipes will be there for you—or,  here  for you. You know what we mean. Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Kaitlin Wayne, Prop Styling by Gerri K. Williams 1/45 Spiced Egg Crepe for One Level up your solo dinner game with this egg recipe. We call it a crepe, but you can also think of it as an omelet—a spice-packed omelet, that is, full of mustard seeds, cumin, and turmeric. View Recipe Ted Cavanaugh 2/45 Jammy Soft-Boiled Eggs Once you get the hang of this easy recipe—the keys are in the timing and the gentle boil—you’ll be adding jammy eggs to everything you make:  salads ,  noodle dishes , and more. View Recipe Photo by Alex Lau, food styling by Chris Morocco 3/45 Grand Aioli Some say that whether or not you can make your own aioli is the mark of a truly good home cook. If you agree but haven’t yet taken it upon yourself to learn, allow this recipe to be your teacher. View Recipe Photo by Emma Fishman, Food Styling by Susan Ottaviano  4/45 Silky Steamed Eggs With Mushrooms Although  steamed eggs  have been around—it’s comfort food in Taiwan, for example, and is often served alongside Korean BBQ—we still think of it as one of the more creative egg recipes out there. View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Spencer Richards, Prop Styling by Marina Bevilacqua 5/45 Eggs en Cocotte Think of the French brunch dish eggs en cocotte as all the best bits of  poached eggs —tender egg whites and custardy, barely set egg yolks—with none of the fuss. View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata.  Food Styling by Susan Ottaviano.  Prop Styling by Maeve Sheridan 6/45 Turkish-Style Poached Eggs With Brown Butter Garlic Chips This egg recipe is a  garlic  lover’s dream: Crispy garlic chips lend textural balance to the soft eggs and creamy yogurt, all of which get a lift from a garnish of chopped fresh herbs. View Recipe Photograph by Emma Fishman, food styling by Susan Ottaviano, prop styling by Sophie Strangio  7/45 Blistered Asparagus Frittata This low-waste, no-flip frittata recipe uses one whole bunch of asparagus, tough stalk ends and all. Feel free to swap in whatever ingredients you already have on hand: a  leek  for the red onion, for example, or a shallot in place of the garlic. View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Judy Kim, Prop Styling by Stephanie De Luca 8/45 Egg Bhurji Strata Prepare and refrigerate this Indian-inspired strata in advance to let the stale bread soak up the egg custard mixture. It’s a great do-ahead weekend breakfast recipe or brunch dish. View Recipe Photograph by Victoria Jane, Food Styling by Mieko Takahashi 9/45 Simple Does It Deviled Eggs Some people consider deviled eggs a retro appetizer. We say, they never go out of style. This version doesn’t stray too far from the classic, but finely chopped celery, scallions, and pickle relish add texture. View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Pearl Jones, Prop Styling by Stephanie De Luca 10/45 Make-Ahead Egg and Cheese Sandwiches This is our ideal breakfast sandwich, not only because it contains cheddar cheese and crunchy fried red onions, but also because it can be prepared ahead. And if you’re more of an  egg-in-a-hole  type, we’ve got you there too. View Recipe Photo by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Pearl Jones 11/45 Tomato and Egg Drop Noodle Soup These are not your average breakfast eggs. In fact, this beloved Hong Kong soup, which relies heavily on  pantry staples , is a better fit for when you need a cozy but easy supper. View Recipe Photo by Emma Fishman, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Elizabeth Jaime 12/45 Molletes A mollete, a Mexican-style open-face sandwich with beans and cheese, doesn’t really exist. Because when you sit down to eat one, you can’t; you must have two.  Molletes . View Recipe Photo by Alex Lau, food styling by Pearl Jones 13/45 Carbonara Lasagna A dish that’s equally delicious served with a bottle of  Lambrusco  at night as it is for breakfast the following morning with  cold brew ? We’ll take it. ( If you want a more traditional carbonara, here’s the silkiest version of the classic pasta dish .) View Recipe Photo by Ted Cavanaugh 14/45 Pickled Eggs Pickling eggs in cracked but intact shells creates a unique tie-dye effect on each one. (Just make sure you crack them yourself, no one should be pickling  an egg that’s gone bad .) If you want a more uniform color, try this recipe for  Beet-Pickled Eggs . View Recipe Photo by Emma Fishman 15/45 Khai Jiao Like those pop-up sponges you might remember from childhood, this Thai-style omelet will start to puff as soon as it hits the hot oil. View Recipe Photograph by Yudi Ela Echevarria, food styling by Micah Morton, prop styling by Sean Dooley, Special thanks to Frank's House 16/45 Peppery Potato Frittata We could create an entire gallery devoted to the  frittata , also known as the most delicious way to use leftovers. We have a version with  lamb and feta , another with  mushrooms and leeks , and another with  chickpeas and greens . (And yes, there are more beyond those.) View Recipe Photo by Alex Lau, food styling by Susie Theodorou, prop styling by Emily Eisen 17/45 Chicken Cobb Salad Eggs with medium-set yolks (that’s a seven-minute egg, for those pros out there) make appearances in some of our favorite meal-worthy salads, such as the  tuna Niçoise  and this modified Cobb. View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Micah Morton, Prop Styling by Tim Ferro 18/45 Migas With Green Salsa What makes migas different from scrambled eggs? Crunchy tortilla tips. Migas literally translates to “crumbs,” as the egg recipe is meant to be a way to use up stale tortillas. View Recipe Photograph by Guang Xu 19/45 Creamy Crab and Boursin Omelet If you’ve never had creamy Boursin Garlic and Fine Herbs cheese—do those people exist?—then we suggest you run to the store immediately, and then make this omelet. View Recipe Photo by Laura Murray, food styling by Susie Theodorou 20/45 Golden Fried Rice With Salmon and Furikake Egg yolks are the secret to superb (and golden)  fried rice ; they help the grains maintain their structure and stay separate from one another instead of becoming a mushy mass. View Recipe Photograph by Emma Fishman, food styling by Kendra Vaculin 21/45 Baked Eggs and Greens in Harissa Tomato Sauce Croutons need not be saved exclusively for salads. In this egg recipe, hand-torn hunks of country-style bread, crisped in a skillet, bring crunch while also soaking up tomato sauce and yogurt. View Recipe Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate Buckens 22/45 French Toast Casserole French toast meets breakfast casserole in this hands-off entertaining brunch dish. This recipe is all about creating a  bread pudding  experience balanced by textural pops of demerara sugar. View Recipe Photograph by Laura Murray, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Sophie Strangio 23/45 Simplest Rosti It’s not a  latke . It’s not a  hash brown . It’s a rosti, a Swiss dish consisting of grated potatoes and onions held together by sheer will (and a firm press in a hot skillet). Naturally, we put fried eggs on top. View Recipe Photo by Chelsie Craig,  Food Styling by Yekaterina Boytsova 24/45 Breakfast Burrito to Go We love to keep the filling for this burrito classic with melty cheese, hot sauce, and avocado, but if you want a  New Mexican–style breakfast burrito , we have that too. View Recipe Photographs by Emma Fishman 25/45 Curried Egg Tartines Of course, we had to include an egg salad recipe on the list. If you prefer a more traditional version for your brunch dish, try these  Egg Salad Tartines With Mixed Herbs , but we find ourselves turning to this curry powder-infused recipe again and again—and finishing it with loads of fresh chives. View Recipe Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Pearl Jones 26/45 Steak and Eggs With Salsa Verde Steak and eggs is one of those special dishes you indulge in when it’s most needed, so make it count: Get a nice hard sear on the meat’s exterior and get those olive-oil-fried eggs real crispy on the edges. View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Pearl Jones, Prop Styling by Gözde Eker 27/45 Masala Skillet Scramble Just a little bit of ground cumin, fresh ginger, and finely chopped jalapeño take this one-pan dish in a totally different direction from your average diner-style egg scramble. View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Thu Buser, Prop Styling by Sean Dooley 28/45 Sheet-Pan Merguez Hash With Fried Eggs How will you take your eggs this morning? May we suggest sunny-side up and placed atop a potato and  sausage  hash, please and thank you very much? View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Taneka Morris, Prop Styling by Gerri K. Williams 29/45 Quick and Cheesy Omelet Roll-Up We’re not concerned with whether or not this flour tortilla roll-up would technically be considered an  egg sandwich . We’re just concerned with how delicious and portable it is. View Recipe Photo by Alex Lau, Styling by Sue Li 30/45 Egg White Chalupa This chalupa has many layers: a crispy fried tortilla, stewed black beans, shredded iceberg lettuce, springy egg whites, hot sauce, cheese, fresh cilantro.… Avocado toast could never. View Recipe Alex Lau 31/45 Salad for Breakfast We love this salad for breakfast: jammy eggs, salty feta, crunchy vegetables. If you’re going low-carb, serve it without the crusty bread, but we like to use it to sop up any extra dressing. View Recipe Photo by Laura Murray. Food styling by Judy Mancini 32/45 Cheesy Egg Bake With Sausage When you want breakfast for dinner, make this egg casserole. The recipe is flexible enough to work with whatever veggies you have in the fridge;  winter squash  works in colder months, but zucchini and feta would be a nice summertime version. View Recipe Photo by Chelsie Craig, styling by Judy Mancini 33/45 Eggs Benedict for a Crowd If you’ve ever tried to make classic eggs Benedict for a crowd, you’ll know that it’s, well, challenging. (The hollandaise sauce alone...) And while it’s true that we’ve never heard “eggs Benedict” and “easy breakfast” used in the same sentence, we figured out a way. View Recipe Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Judy Kim, Prop Styling by Stephanie De Luca 34/45 Bibimbap There is no definitive bibimbap recipe, but the one constant is  rice  topped with an array of garnishes. For us, the other nonnegotiable is a fried egg on top. View Recipe Alex Lau 35/45 BA's Best Quiche Lorraine Buttery, bacon-y, and custardy, quiche Lorraine is an all-time classic. But we also love  this version made with caraway-scented cabbage and leeks . Served with an apple and radish salad, it makes for a great  Easter brunch dish . View Recipe Ted Cavanaugh 36/45 Chorizo Breakfast Tacos With Potato Hash and Fried Eggs We recommend olive-oil-basted fried eggs for topping these tacos: You’ll tilt your skillet toward you so that oil pools at the front edge of the pan, and use a big soup spoon to bathe the egg whites in that oil until they’re set. View Recipe Alex Lau 37/45 Green Shakshuka Shakshuka  typically involves eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, olive oil, peppers, onion, and garlic, but we love a riff. This version is made green by Swiss chard, serrano chiles, and cilantro. (Bonus: Here’s another version made with  butternut squash .) View Recipe Ted Cavanaugh 38/45 Hard-Boiled Eggs Ask a dozen cooks  how to boil eggs  and you’ll get a dozen different answers. This is our method for perfectly hard-boiled eggs—and we’ve got some tips for peeling too (a.k.a. the only thing about eggs we don’t love). View Recipe Marcus Nilsson 39/45 Rigatoni With Lemon-Chile Pesto and Grated Egg Once you finely grate hard-boiled egg yolks for this pasta, you’ll come up with all kinds of ideas for the garnish: Use it as a topping for crostini, soup, or steamed veggies. View Recipe Alex Lau 40/45 Sumac Fried Eggs With Red Chile and Garlic A little sumac brings brightness to these olive-oil-fried eggs. If you’re new to this tart, citrusy spice and want to play with it some more, try these recipes for  Sumac Chicken With Onions and Flatbread  and  Smashed Green Beans With Lemony Sumac Dressing . View Recipe Peden + Munk 41/45 Lentil and Egg Stew Make use of that leftover Parmesan rind with this vegetarian  stew recipe , which can be prepared three days in advance. When you’re ready to eat, finish the dish by poaching eggs right in lentil mixture. View Recipe Jenny Rosenstrach, Andy Ward 42/45 Spanish Tortilla This egg dish begins with potatoes. Slowly cook them along with onions in lots—we mean one and a half cups—of olive oil, then save the leftover oil to make mayonnaise (or whatever else you want, frankly). View Recipe Elizabeth Cecil 43/45 Croque-Madame With Cranberry-Mustard Relish You know how the cheese sometimes oozes out of a  grilled cheese  while it’s cooking? It then gets all golden and crunchy when it hits the skillet? This recipe is dedicated to making that happen on purpose. View Recipe Alex Lau 44/45 Reuben Dutch Baby A Dutch baby is similar to a  large Yorkshire pudding  and can be thought of as an  oven-baked pancake . This version, made with Swiss cheese and pastrami, makes for a hearty breakfast. View Recipe Photo By Zach Desart 45/45 Scotch Eggs This egg recipe isn’t so much a breakfast idea as it is a meaty, salty, crunchy  drinking snack  idea. Scotch eggs, the gastropub staple, are simply meant for a pint of beer.

      Who We Are    

 

Simply Recipes is here to help you cook delicious meals with less stress and more joy. We offer recipes and cooking advice  for home cooks, by home cooks . Helping create “kitchen wins” is what we’re all about.

 

 

 

Simply Recipes was founded in 2003 by Elise Bauer as a home cooking blog to record her favorite family recipes. Today, Simply Recipes has grown into a trusted resource for home cooks with more than 3,000 tested recipes, guides, and meal plans, drawing over 15 million readers each month from around the world. We’re supported by a diverse group of recipe developers, food writers, recipe and product testers, photographers, and other creative professionals.

 

 

      Our History    

 

Elise Bauer was a busy Silicon Valley executive when she became sick with a flu that wouldn’t go away in 2001. In 2003, Elise moved home with her parents and lived with them for several years, recovering from chronic fatigue and documenting her parents’ cooking on Simply Recipes. ( Here’s more of that story .) Over the years, what started as a small blog grew to reach millions of readers every month! In 2020, Simply Recipes was acquired by Dotdash Meredith, a New York-based media company.

 

 

      Recipe Development & Testing    

 

Our recipes primarily use fresh, unprocessed ingredients but we also believe there is a time and a place for canned, frozen, and other prepared ingredients. We believe in a diet that includes a wide variety of foods: real butter and cream, extra virgin olive oil, eggs, lots of fruits and vegetables, and protein from meat, fish, beans, and cheese. Plus cake for dessert.

 

 

 

There are three things we think about when deciding if a recipe is good enough to go on Simply Recipes:

 

 

 

 First, does it work?  Recipes need to be easy to follow and provide reliable results, every time.

 

 

 

 Second, is it delicious?  Does the dish make us smile inside and out? Do we want to eat the whole batch by ourselves? 

 

 

 

 Third, is it worth the effort?  Do we want to make it again (and again and again)?

 

 

 

To make sure each of these standards is met, we start by working with expert recipe developers  — people with the experience and knowledge to not only develop a good recipe in their own kitchens, but to make sure that recipe works in yours. Next, we thoroughly review and edit every recipe in-house line by line. Finally, each new recipe is run by our team of recipe testers working in home kitchens with the same pots, pans, and tools that you use in yours. Only after all this is the recipe shared on Simply Recipes.

 

 

 

Additionally, at Simply Recipes, we aspire to provide the highest quality content produced by humans, for humans. It is against our guidelines to publish automatically generated content using AI (artificial intelligence) writing tools such as ChatGPT.

 

 

 

 Have feedback for us? We’d love to hear from you! Please contact the team at  contact@simplyrecipes.com . 

 

 

      Diversity & Inclusion    

 

Everyone is welcome at the Simply Recipes table: people of all races, religions, genders, sexual orientations, ages, backgrounds, and abilities. We strive to be a resource for every home cook, and we consciously work to make this inclusion felt in every part of the site, from the individuals we hire to the recipes we share.

 

 

 

We’re not perfect, but we hope to get more right than we get wrong.  For a full look at our 2023 Diversity & Inclusion commitments and a recap of our commitments and progress from previous years, please see  HERE .

 

 

 

 Procedure for Reporting a Concern 

 

 

 

If you have concerns about cultural appropriation, bias, or insensitivity in any of our articles, please let us know via  contact@simplyrecipes.com . Your concern will be reviewed by a member of our editorial team and by a member of our Anti-Bias Review Board. Once the best course of action is determined, we send a reply to your email letting you know how the matter is being addressed.

 

 

      Comments    

 

We review and approve every comment left on the site, and generally respond to questions within 1 to 3 days. When leaving comments, we ask that you think of Simply Recipes as our home. Constructive feedback is always welcome, but rude, mean, disrespectful, or spammy comments are not welcome and will not be approved.

He got his start in print design, making the switch to digital about a decade ago. Nick is focused on designing experiences that are both fun and easy to use. He received a BA from Flagler College in St. Augustine, Florida. He recently moved to Charleston, SC and when not working you can usually find him in the garden.  Nick loves to try new things in the kitchen, a few years ago he attempted to cook a Christmas goose for his extended family and while it was an utter disaster, it was a good learning experience.
