​
Ingredients
•35 ounces fish (tilapia)
•5.5 tablespoons lime
•5 tablespoons fish sauce
•1 tablespoon palm sugar (chop to measure)
•10 cloves garlic (pounded)
•10 chilies (pounded)
•1⁄3 cup coriander (chopped)
•2 coriander root (pounded)
•1⁄3 cup celery (chopped)
•2 lemongrass (cut in 2 or 3 pieces)
Instructions

Make sure the fish is cleaned thoroughly. Slice 3–4 cuts into the fish on both sides.
Stuff the belly of the fish with the lemongrass.
Place the fish in a steamer, and steam for 10–15 minutes, depending on the size of the fish. Ideally, you want to lay the fish on top of a dish.
Pound garlic, coriander root, and chilies in a mortar and pestle.
Add palm sugar, fish sauce, fresh lime juice and mix into 1 sauce.
After steaming, transfer to a serving dish and top with the sauce, then garnish with coriander and celery. Serve immediately, with a portion of rice.
