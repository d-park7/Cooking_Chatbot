Ingredients:

Lamb shanks: one per serving
Mashed potatoes: about one large Russet per portion, pecorino cheese and butter to taste.
Vegetables of choice: I used frozen fine beans and carrots, about half an lb per person
Soup: I just used a corn soup bouillon and fancied it up a bit
Dessert: Panna cotta is pretty low effort and high reward. I used 1.5g of gelatine powder, a dash of sugar and about 100ml of milk. But substituting some or all of the milk for cream makes for a richer product, and corn starch can work in lieu of gelatine. Some vanilla powder or extract would also be nice, as is fruit for topping.

Instructions:
Cover lamb shanks with salt and pepper two days before serving.
The next day,

Cover shanks with foil and roast at 140c/285f for 2 to 3 hours, or until tender.
Meanwhile, make mashed potatoes with pecorino and butter, and keep refrigerated until ready to serve.
Bloom about 1.5g of gelatine powder in a bit of hot water and whisk it, along with a tiny dash of sugar, into about 100ml of milk heated on the stove until lukewarm. Poured it into two ramekins and let them set overnight in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap.

On the day you want to eat,

Pull the shanks out of the fridge and broil until well browned. Sop up the drippings with bread and make croutons.
Make soup according to package instructions while the shanks are broiling. Pul croutons out of the oven before they burn and serve with the soup while the oven continues to keep the shanks warm.
When ready for the main course, microwave the mashed potatoes, saute your vegetables and build your plate.
Enjoy conversation and some wine before pulling the panna cotta out of the fridge and serving for dessert.

Enjoy!
