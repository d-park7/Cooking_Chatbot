Id be more than happy to try this one.
permalink embed save report give award reply – kelowana    points  points  points    hours ago    children We did the cauliflower steak and loved it unfortunately its just … meaningless.
From one even a big one cauliflower you get maybe two steaks rest its just crumbles.
As nice a steak looks its just one.
The rest is always crumbled so why bother doing the steak thing at all Just crumble it all and chuck it in the oven.
Or does someone has an better idea how to do it permalink embed save report give award reply – Tkj    points  points  points    hours ago    children No because you are right.
permalink embed save parent report give award reply – theravingbandit    point  points  points    hours ago    children do it Miznon style you can find recipes on Google parboil it then roast it WHOLE possibly with leaves still on.
You can cut it in half once its done.
serve with tahini lemon sauce.
permalink embed save parent report give award reply – IntoTheMurkyWaters    points  points  points    hours ago    children Looks good but i would be hungry in  minutes again… permalink embed save report give award reply – MEEZETTE    points  points  points    hours ago    children Beets are pretty fulfilling permalink embed save parent report give award reply – RubyNotTawny    points  points  points    hours ago    children Same here but if you add a chicken thigh or a piece of fish even a bit of sausage and its a nice meal.
permalink embed save parent report give award reply – goddessofcosmos    points  points  points    hours ago    child Youre not going to get vegan appreciation over here tbh lmao.
That being said I love cauliflower steaks this looks delicious Ive gone plant based before and have done similar.
Ill tell ya its hard to be satiated with just cauliflower and potatoes though.
permalink embed save report give award reply – BushyEyes    points  points  points    hours ago    children Some plantbased protein would help this one I think crispy chickpeas or white beans would help make this more filling.
even a side of stewed lentils.
it looks fantastic though permalink embed save parent report give award reply – AcceptablePath  S     points  points  points    hours ago    children How I made it Ingredients for  people •  cauliflower about  mediumlarge head • Extra virgin olive oil to coat • Sea salt • Black pepper •  smallmedium sized potatoes • ¼ cup butter • ½ cup of Milk •  grams of marinated beetroots Recipe Cauliflower  Preheat oven to  degrees.
Place cauliflower in a large mixing bowl.
Pour on enough olive oil to coat season generously with salt and pepper and toss gently until evenly coated.
Lay cauliflower pieces out on a baking sheet.
Drizzle any remaining oil from the bowl on top.
Bake turning once until caramelized on edges and tender  to  minutes.
For mash potatoes  Boil the potatoes after its boiled add salt milk and butter and mash the everything together.
For the beetroots  Just cut it in small pieces drizzle some oil and its ready.
ENJOY permalink embed save report give award reply – PuzzledKiwi    points  points  points    hours ago    child Everything looks good especially the cauliflower.
Are the beets uncooked It seems that it is but Ive never had it that way before so I wanted to double check.
permalink embed save parent report give award reply – mdmd    point  points  points    hours ago    children It reads like theyre pickled.
Pretty common way to eat them in Europe the UK especially.

permalink embed save report give award reply – Quadbinilium    point  points  points    hours ago    children Thats some very fancy plating Youve got experience with this dish it seems xD I love baked cauliflower with some cheese on top and beetroot is a super undervalued side permalink embed save report give award reply – Mammaw    points  point  points    hours ago    child Would it fill you up if you put it between a loaf of cheesy garlic bread Jk.
It does look amazing though.
My DIL is vegetarian and I feel like I keep making same  dishes for her.
I think she would love this.
Going to try it.
I will just grill some chicken and have some type of bread too.
Everyone happy Yum.
permalink embed save report give award reply – ttrockwood    points  point  points    hours ago    children Just add some marinated chickpeas or make it a lentil beet salad.
No chickens needed permalink embed save parent report give award reply  KingOfKorners   comment score below threshold  points  points  points    hours ago    child Needs meat permalink embed save report give award reply – TheCrankyOctopus    points  points  points    hours ago    children Cauliflower almost looks like brains though.
So close enough Jokes aside it doesnt need meat.
It just needs some more proteins probably.
But they surely dont need to be from meat.
