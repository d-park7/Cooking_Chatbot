thighs The sauce is a simple mix of broth and cream plus  sundried tomatoes We love using sundried tomatoes for their rich concentrated flavor They taste like supercharged tomatoes and make everything theyre in even more craveable As the gnocchi bubbles along in the sauce it soaks up all of that delicious flavor When youre shopping look for bonein skinon chicken thighs that are on the smaller side about five ounces each Choosing smaller chicken thighs will make sure the meat cooks in the same amount of time as the gnocchi If you can only find large chicken thighs cut them down a bit and save the chicken scraps for a  stirfry You can swap chicken breasts in for the thighs but youll need to reduce the cooking time since they cook much faster After the chicken and gnocchi are out of the oven

‘Ultimate Comfort Food The cookbook author puts a Mexican spin on the brunch classic by Jaya Saxena Apr   am EDT If you buy something from an Eater link Vox Media may earn a commission See our  ethics

Pocket Flipboard Email Dina ÁvilaEater Rick Martínez did not grow up eating rajas con crema the first time he tried the dish was about three years ago as he was researching for his cookbook  Mi Cocina The flavors were familiar but it was a combination of things that I had never had before he says And to me it was just so comforting What he did grow up eating and loving was quiche His mom had one recipe in her repertoire likely given to her on an index card by one of her coworkers that mixed spinach Swiss cheese tomatoes and celery seed This is the s and s so quiches werent crazy common certainly in Texas Martínez says but he and his dad always anticipated quiche night So when he thought to combine the flavors of rajas con crema with quiche it felt fated Its something very new and then mashed up with something very old and comforting he says And so the combination is just sort of ultimate comfort food The rajas con crema quiche emphasizes the dishs creaminess and mellowness mixing soft baked egg with cream queso fresco and sweet starchy corn Its also made even richer by being baked in a deepdish pie pan Martínez uses one from  Oxo Youre getting that pop of charred poblano but everything else is just super rich and creamy and eggy he says There is also perhaps a more historical reason these flavors go together Martínez notes the  French occupation of Mexico  resulted in quite a lot of French influence particularly in the central part of the country in Mexico City French staples like bechamel sauce and crepes have since found a home in Mexican cuisine Like any quiche this one is adaptable depending on what you have Martínez says if you can find Mexican corn its starchier and more toothsome than its sweeter American counterpart but either will work fine Also if your grocery doesnt have queso fresco farmers cheese or dollops of ricotta will give you that creamy but fresh texture Here Martínez pairs the quiche with a tomatillo vinaigrette which can be drizzled on top or tossed with a side salad but the quiche works well with any acidic salsa or side Its going to be good if you have a little something to cleanse the palate says Martínez and then go back in as if it was your first bite Rajas con Crema Quiche With TomatilloSerrano Vinaigrette Recipe Serves  Ingredients For the crust  teaspoons sugar ½ teaspoons sea salt  cups allpurpose flour plus more for surface  tablespoons cold unsalted butter cut into pieces  tablespoons cold lard or vegetable shortening  tablespoon apple cider vinegar ½ tablespoons ice water For the filling and assembly

light agave syrup or honey  teaspoons sea salt ⅓ packed cup cilantro leaves and tender stems ½ cup extravirgin olive oil romaine or little gem lettuce leaves for serving Tools  inch deep dish inch deep pie plate Instructions For the crust Step   Pulse the sugar salt and  cups flour in a food processor until combined Add the butter and lard and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal with a few pieces of butter and lard visible about  onesecond pulses With the motor running drizzle in the vinegar and ice water and pulse until the dough is still crumbly but just holds together when squeezed add  teaspoon water at a time if necessary but be careful not to overwork the dough Step   Turn out the dough onto a work surface Knead  to  times pressing just to incorporate any shaggy pieces Flatten into a inchwide disk Wrap with plastic wrap and chill for at least  hours Step   Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to  degrees On a lightly floured work surface roll out the dough to a inch round Transfer to a inch deepdish cup pie plate Pick up the edges and allow the dough to slump down into the dish letting the excess dough hang over the edge of the rim Trim the dough leaving about a inch overhang Fold the overhang under pinch and crimp Chill  minutes Step   Line the dough with parchment paper or foil leaving some overhang Fill with pie weights or dried beans Bake until the crust is dry around the edges and just beginning to lightly brown  to  minutes Carefully remove the parchment and weights and reduce the oven temperature to  degrees Bake until the crust is set and begins to brown in the center  to  minutes Transfer to a wire rack and let cool Do ahead The dough can be made  days ahead keep chilled or freeze up to  months The crust can be baked one day ahead tightly wrap and store at room temperature For the filling and assembly Step   Using a gas stove or grill on high heat char the poblanos directly over the flame resting the peppers on the grates until charred on all sides about  minutes per side Alternatively arrange a rack directly under the broiler and preheat to high Char the poblanos on a rimmed baking sheet under the broiler turning occasionally until charred on all sides  to  minutes per side Transfer to a large bowl wrap tightly with plastic wrap and let steam for  minutes Carefully remove the stems peel and

Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to  degrees Combine the eggs milk crema and  teaspoons of the salt in a blender on mediumlow speed until completely smooth and homogenous about  seconds Step   Place the pie plate on a rimmed baking sheet Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the bottom of crust Top with the poblano mixture Pour half of the custard into the crust Transfer the quiche to the oven then carefully pour the remaining custard into the crust adding the rest this way will prevent it from spilling during the quiches transfer to the oven Bake the quiche until its edges are set but its center slightly wobbles  to  minutes it will continue to set after baking Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for at least  hours before slicing Do ahead The quiche can be baked  day

Baiocchi photo Lizzie Munro Cocktails Its Rome With a View or Nowhere April   Story Talia Baiocchi photo Lizzie Munro Theres a reason this contemporary spin on the Americano has become an industry darling Content Blocks When Michael McIlroy created the  Rome With a View  not a single person had tagged a social media post with  #spritzlife  aperitivo was a word and custom firmly contained within the borders of Italy and its likeminded European and South American brethren and we were still  years away from J Lo releasing  her very own take  on the breezy lowABV Italianinspired drinks that would sweep the United States in the late s Few customers if any at all were showing up to bars looking for a riff on the  Americano I would regularly get customers at Milk  Honey who would tell me they hated bitter [drinks] so this was my ‘No you dont try this response says McIlroy It was  and the cocktail aesthetic at that time was still focused on faithful reinterpretations of preProhibition classics McIlroy was among this group of rebirthers  as Scott Hocker calls them  he has the  modern   classics  to prove it But his interests extended beyond the late th century even if his approach was rooted in the minimalist principles of those early cocktails He created the Rome With a View—a simple combination of Campari dry vermouth lime juice and a tiny measure of simple syrup topped off with soda water—as  a lowABV drink that could be easily replicated around the bar community Recipe Rome With a View A measure of citrus kicks up this bracingly bittersweet spritz What is effectively a mashup of a  rickey  spirit lime soda and the  Americano  Campari sweet vermouth soda is so tethered to the spirit of predinner Italian drinking that it feels as though its been a part of the canon all along And yet its modern enough that amid the crush of competitors born of the same ethos it is the contemporary aperitivo drink that I return to most frequently It does not tire because it was built to deliver It has the smack of sour candy the characteristic bite of Campari and the thirstquenching refreshment of seltzer topped off with a squeeze of fresh lime Its the cocktail equivalent of getting hit in the face with sea spray Aside from being undeniably pleasurable to drink it is also endlessly permutable Case in point Chip Tyndales earthy autumnal  Seven Hills  Matt Belangers tikified  Quincentuple Your Money  and—McIlroys favorite take on the drink—Dan Greenbaums  Second Serve Even McIlroy has over the years riffed on his own drink culminating with the most recent example

Product Reviews Meet the Team About Dotdash Meredith Contact Us Work With Us Write for Us Advertise With Us Who We Are Simply Recipes is here to help you cook delicious meals with less stress and more joy We offer recipes and cooking advice  for home cooks by home cooks Helping create kitchen wins is what were all about Simply Recipes was founded in  by Elise Bauer as a home cooking blog to record her favorite family recipes Today Simply Recipes has grown into a trusted resource for home cooks with more than  tested recipes guides and meal plans drawing over  million readers each month from around the world Were supported by a diverse group of recipe developers food writers recipe and product testers photographers and other creative professionals Our History Elise Bauer was a busy Silicon Valley executive when she became sick with a flu that wouldnt go away in In  Elise moved home with her parents and lived with them for several years recovering from chronic fatigue and documenting her parents cooking on Simply Recipes Heres more of that story Over the years what started as a small blog grew to reach millions of readers every month In  Simply Recipes was acquired by Dotdash Meredith a New Yorkbased media company Recipe Development  Testing Our recipes primarily use fresh unprocessed ingredients but we also believe there is a time and a place for canned frozen and other prepared ingredients We believe in a diet that includes a wide variety of foods real butter and cream extra virgin olive oil eggs lots of fruits and vegetables and protein from meat fish beans and cheese Plus cake for dessert There are three things we think about when deciding if a recipe is good enough to go on Simply Recipes First does it work Recipes need to be easy to follow and provide reliable results every time Second is it delicious Does the dish make us smile inside and out Do we want to eat the whole batch by ourselves Third is it worth the effort Do we want to make it again and again and again To make sure each of these standards is met we start by working with expert recipe developers  — people with the experience and knowledge to not only develop a good recipe in their own kitchens but to make sure that recipe works in yours Next we thoroughly review and edit every recipe inhouse line by line Finally each new recipe is run by our team of recipe testers working in home kitchens with the same pots pans and tools that you use in yours Only after all this is the recipe shared on Simply Recipes Additionally at Simply Recipes we aspire to provide the highest quality

thighs The sauce is a simple mix of broth and cream plus  sundried tomatoes We love using sundried tomatoes for their rich concentrated flavor They taste like supercharged tomatoes and make everything theyre in even more craveable As the gnocchi bubbles along in the sauce it soaks up all of that delicious flavor When youre shopping look for bonein skinon chicken thighs that are on the smaller side about five ounces each Choosing smaller chicken thighs will make sure the meat cooks in the same amount of time as the gnocchi If you can only find large chicken thighs cut them down a bit and save the chicken scraps for a  stirfry You can swap chicken breasts in for the thighs but youll need to reduce the cooking time since they cook much faster After the chicken and gnocchi are out of the oven

Pocket Flipboard Email Dina ÁvilaEater Rick Martínez did not grow up eating rajas con crema the first time he tried the dish was about three years ago as he was researching for his cookbook  Mi Cocina The flavors were familiar but it was a combination of things that I had never had before he says And to me it was just so comforting What he did grow up eating and loving was quiche His mom had one recipe in her repertoire likely given to her on an index card by one of her coworkers that mixed spinach Swiss cheese tomatoes and celery seed This is the s and s so quiches werent crazy common certainly in Texas Martínez says but he and his dad always anticipated quiche night So when he thought to combine the flavors of rajas con crema with quiche it felt fated Its something very new and then mashed up with something very old and comforting he says And so the combination is just sort of ultimate comfort food The rajas con crema quiche emphasizes the dishs creaminess and mellowness mixing soft baked egg with cream queso fresco and sweet starchy corn Its also made even richer by being baked in a deepdish pie pan Martínez uses one from  Oxo Youre getting that pop of charred poblano but everything else is just super rich and creamy and eggy he says There is also perhaps a more historical reason these flavors go together Martínez notes the  French occupation of Mexico  resulted in quite a lot of French influence particularly in the central part of the country in Mexico City French staples like bechamel sauce and crepes have since found a home in Mexican cuisine Like any quiche this one is adaptable depending on what you have Martínez says if you can find Mexican corn its starchier and more toothsome than its sweeter American counterpart but either will work fine Also if your grocery doesnt have queso fresco farmers cheese or dollops of ricotta will give you that creamy but fresh texture Here Martínez pairs the quiche with a tomatillo vinaigrette which can be drizzled on top or tossed with a side salad but the quiche works well with any acidic salsa or side Its going to be good if you have a little something to cleanse the palate says Martínez and then go back in as if it was your first bite Rajas con Crema Quiche With TomatilloSerrano Vinaigrette Recipe Serves  Ingredients For the crust  teaspoons sugar ½ teaspoons sea salt  cups allpurpose flour plus more for surface  tablespoons cold unsalted butter cut into pieces  tablespoons cold lard or vegetable shortening  tablespoon apple cider vinegar ½ tablespoons ice water For the filling and assembly

light agave syrup or honey  teaspoons sea salt ⅓ packed cup cilantro leaves and tender stems ½ cup extravirgin olive oil romaine or little gem lettuce leaves for serving Tools  inch deep dish inch deep pie plate Instructions For the crust Step   Pulse the sugar salt and  cups flour in a food processor until combined Add the butter and lard and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal with a few pieces of butter and lard visible about  onesecond pulses With the motor running drizzle in the vinegar and ice water and pulse until the dough is still crumbly but just holds together when squeezed add  teaspoon water at a time if necessary but be careful not to overwork the dough Step   Turn out the dough onto a work surface Knead  to  times pressing just to incorporate any shaggy pieces Flatten into a inchwide disk Wrap with plastic wrap and chill for at least  hours Step   Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to  degrees On a lightly floured work surface roll out the dough to a inch round Transfer to a inch deepdish cup pie plate Pick up the edges and allow the dough to slump down into the dish letting the excess dough hang over the edge of the rim Trim the dough leaving about a inch overhang Fold the overhang under pinch and crimp Chill  minutes Step   Line the dough with parchment paper or foil leaving some overhang Fill with pie weights or dried beans Bake until the crust is dry around the edges and just beginning to lightly brown  to  minutes Carefully remove the parchment and weights and reduce the oven temperature to  degrees Bake until the crust is set and begins to brown in the center  to  minutes Transfer to a wire rack and let cool Do ahead The dough can be made  days ahead keep chilled or freeze up to  months The crust can be baked one day ahead tightly wrap and store at room temperature For the filling and assembly Step   Using a gas stove or grill on high heat char the poblanos directly over the flame resting the peppers on the grates until charred on all sides about  minutes per side Alternatively arrange a rack directly under the broiler and preheat to high Char the poblanos on a rimmed baking sheet under the broiler turning occasionally until charred on all sides  to  minutes per side Transfer to a large bowl wrap tightly with plastic wrap and let steam for  minutes Carefully remove the stems peel and

seconds Step   Place the pie plate on a rimmed baking sheet Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the bottom of crust Top with the poblano mixture Pour half of the custard into the crust Transfer the quiche to the oven then carefully pour the remaining custard into the crust adding the rest this way will prevent it from spilling during the quiches transfer to the oven Bake the quiche until its edges are set but its center slightly wobbles  to  minutes it will continue to set after baking Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for at least  hours before slicing Do ahead The quiche can be baked  day

Baiocchi photo Lizzie Munro Cocktails Its Rome With a View or Nowhere April   Story Talia Baiocchi photo Lizzie Munro Theres a reason this contemporary spin on the Americano has become an industry darling Content Blocks When Michael McIlroy created the  Rome With a View  not a single person had tagged a social media post with  #spritzlife  aperitivo was a word and custom firmly contained within the borders of Italy and its likeminded European and South American brethren and we were still  years away from J Lo releasing  her very own take  on the breezy lowABV Italianinspired drinks that would sweep the United States in the late s Few customers if any at all were showing up to bars looking for a riff on the  Americano I would regularly get customers at Milk  Honey who would tell me they hated bitter [drinks] so this was my ‘No you dont try this response says McIlroy It was  and the cocktail aesthetic at that time was still focused on faithful reinterpretations of preProhibition classics McIlroy was among this group of rebirthers  as Scott Hocker calls them  he has the  modern   classics  to prove it But his interests extended beyond the late th century even if his approach was rooted in the minimalist principles of those early cocktails He created the Rome With a View—a simple combination of Campari dry vermouth lime juice and a tiny measure of simple syrup topped off with soda water—as  a lowABV drink that could be easily replicated around the bar community Recipe Rome With a View A measure of citrus kicks up this bracingly bittersweet spritz What is effectively a mashup of a  rickey  spirit lime soda and the  Americano  Campari sweet vermouth soda is so tethered to the spirit of predinner Italian drinking that it feels as though its been a part of the canon all along And yet its modern enough that amid the crush of competitors born of the same ethos it is the contemporary aperitivo drink that I return to most frequently It does not tire because it was built to deliver It has the smack of sour candy the characteristic bite of Campari and the thirstquenching refreshment of seltzer topped off with a squeeze of fresh lime Its the cocktail equivalent of getting hit in the face with sea spray Aside from being undeniably pleasurable to drink it is also endlessly permutable Case in point Chip Tyndales earthy autumnal  Seven Hills  Matt Belangers

joy We offer recipes and cooking advice  for home cooks by home cooks Helping create kitchen wins is what were all about Simply Recipes was founded in  by Elise Bauer as a home cooking blog to record her favorite family recipes Today Simply Recipes has grown into a trusted resource for home cooks with more than  tested recipes guides and meal plans drawing over  million readers each month from around the world Were supported by a diverse group of recipe developers food writers recipe and product testers photographers and other creative professionals Our History Elise Bauer was a busy Silicon Valley executive when she became sick with a flu that wouldnt go away in In  Elise moved home with her parents and lived with them for several years recovering from chronic fatigue and documenting her parents cooking on Simply Recipes Heres more of that story Over the years what started as a small blog grew to reach millions of readers every month In  Simply Recipes was acquired by Dotdash Meredith a New Yorkbased media company Recipe Development  Testing Our recipes primarily use fresh unprocessed ingredients but we also believe there is a time and a place for canned frozen and other prepared ingredients We believe in a diet that includes a wide variety of foods real butter and cream extra virgin olive oil eggs lots of fruits and vegetables and protein from meat fish beans and cheese Plus cake for dessert There are three things we think about when deciding if a recipe is good enough to go on Simply Recipes First does it work Recipes need to be easy to follow and provide reliable results every time Second is it delicious Does the dish make us smile inside and out Do we want to eat the whole batch by ourselves Third is it worth the effort Do we want to make it again and again and again To make sure each of these standards is met we start by working with expert recipe developers  — people with the experience and knowledge to not only develop a good recipe in their own kitchens but to make sure that recipe works in yours Next we thoroughly review and edit every recipe inhouse line by line Finally each new recipe is run by our team of recipe testers working in home kitchens with the same pots pans and tools that you use in yours Only after all this is the recipe shared on Simply Recipes Additionally at Simply Recipes we aspire to provide the highest quality
