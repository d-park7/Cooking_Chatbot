Already tried to cook it once turned out underwhelming and overcooked permalink embed save report give award reply – markandanapantree    points  points  points    year ago    children This is what we do which we love ORANGE TERIYAKI SALMON httpspantree.corecipespostorangesalmon.html Makes  portions Ingredients   salmon fillets   full tablespoons soft light brown sugar  ml soy sauce  ml water  ml orange juice   tablespoon toasted sesame oil   teaspoons grated ginger   cloves garlic minced   teaspoon cornflour   teaspoons water  Salt to taste for seasoning the salmon  Toasted sesame oil for frying the salmon  Optional toppings sesame seeds spring onions Method For the teriyaki sauce in a saucepan combine the soy sauce ml water orange juice sesame oil ginger and garlic.
Cook over medium low heat for  minutes stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile prepare the salmon.
Pat dry the salmon fillets with paper towels this will help them crunch up during frying and season with salt.
Heat up a frying pan on medium high heat add a drizzle of sesame oil and place the salmon fillets skin side down once the pan is hot.
Fry the fillets for  minutes on each side to get the skin crispy and the top golden.
While the salmon is resting create a paste with the cornflour and  teaspoons of water.
Add the paste to the sauce and cook for an additional  minutes over low heat until thickened stirring constantly.
Pour the sauce over the salmon or for a neater presentation brush the fillets with sauce and serve the remaining sauce on the side.
Add your toppings to taste and serve with any sides of choice.

Take enough aluminium foil to cover the tray and Incase the fish at the same time.
On the aluminium foil in the tray you place the fish spread the garlic evenly after preference.

For someone on keto anything without noodles would be.
If you have to watch your salt intake it would be pretty tough with most soupy casseroles.
That being said There are a ton of veggie filled casseroles.
The green bean casserole on the back of the Campbells cream of mushroom can is full of fiber If you Google cheesy veggie casserole youll see one full of carrots cauliflower and broccoli with cheese.

permalink embed save report give award reply – JoudanOrBryce    point  points  points    year ago    child What are some good venison recipes I know it isnt common but I have the opportunity to cook some and I would like some ideas or direction to take it permalink embed save report give award reply – jwdaddy    points  points  points    year ago    children Sometimes I marinate it in a mixture of Worcestershire sauce fresh squeezed orange juice sliced white onions minced garlic and ground black pepper.
I honestly dont use exact measurements for it just eye ball it.
But definitely go easy on the pepper... use maybe  teaspoon at most.
Marinate at least  hrs.
or overnight.
I do this when Im planning on grilling it and its tender and delicious.
Something I do with venison cuts is I season it like I do my fried chicken and fried pork chops Make a rub that has  Tblspn.
Seasoned Salt  Tblspn.
Garlic Powder  Tblspn.
Paprika  Tblspn.
dried Orgeno  tspn.
ground Black Pepper Mix well.
I pat dry the venison then season liberally with rub.
From there you can either store it in a ziplock bag to marinate or go ahead and roll it in allpurpose flour.
After rolling in flour let it sit for about  minutes in order for the flour to adhere better to the meat as well as help bring the core temp of the meat up a bit so it cooks evenly.
In a skillet over medium heat pour some oil in.
Once oil is hot just place your seasoned floured venison in the skillet and cook for about  minutes a side depending on how thick the cut of meat is.
You can also make a gravy with the drippings after pulling the meat.
Not fancy recipes just some good country cookin.
I know this a bit late of a response but maybe something for the future you could use.
Hope this helps.

Maybe if you went hotsweet or sweet and sour sauce it would be fine for the rice.

Thanks for the suggestions permalink embed save parent report give award reply – BooptyB    point  points  points    year ago    children There is more to Wellingtons than just beef I know of Salmon Wellington recipes as well.
Wellingtons do have a good difficulty level.
Meringue pies are a bit tricky too.
You dont have to limit yourself to just lemon just about any acidic fruit juice will do but one key note is fresh squeezed and seedless so strain seeds is best If you can meringue you can béarnaise Technically.
So the Meringue is actually the egg white fluffy topping but the filling thickened with eggs is close to how to make a béarnaise sauce.
The sauce and filling both take a little time and patience.
You dont want your heat too hot or too cool.
Its good to know the burner youre working on and its medium level.
Too hot and your egg cooks and scrambled leaving sauce chunky to cool and you have runny sauce with raw egg.
It takes a little practice.
Do it again and again and you will find it Egg thickening of sauces will open you a bunch of recipes that require these type of sauces on top.
I highly recommend practicing with this.
You get this and then there are the butter thickening of sauces recipes suave as chicken picante or lemon butter sauce with capers.
The technique of thickening with butter is what gives those pictures you see make the sauce look like a gravy on top as opposed to just as flavoring.
