Ã—    Duck Dumplings Poultry    i.redd.it  submitted   day ago  by  BushyEyes  comments share save hide report loading... all  comments sorted by  best top new controversial old random qa live beta Want to add to the discussion Post a comment Create an account â€“ BushyEyes  S     points  points  points    day ago * Â   children Recipe here originally  Duck Dumplings I based this recipe off my duck egg roll recipe which Ive made several times now and its always a huge hit.
I made a few modifications to the filling based on ingredients I had readily available but the filling is fantastic with or without mushrooms.
You can also use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store  just make sure you finely chop it.
Roast duck â€“Â poundÂ duck giblets neck and feet reserved for another use  orange quartered Salt and pepper Filling inchÂ piece of ginger peeled and minced Â clovesÂ garlic peeled and minced Â scallions trimmed and minced Â Thai chili peppers trimmed and minced Â tablespoons hoisin sauce Â tablespoons thinÂ soy sauce â€“ tablespoons sweet chili sauce optional to taste Â½ orange juiced Salt if needed Dumplings â€“ dumpling wrappers Sliced scallion greens optional for garnish Water Sauce â…“ cup black vinegar â€“ teaspoons chili oil  teaspoon sesame oil  teaspoon sesame seeds Prepare the duck Preheat the oven to ÂºF.
Line a roasting pan with foil.
Place a raised rack in the pan and set aside.
Pat the duck dry and season it all over with salt and pepper.
Stuff the cavity with the orange wedges.
Truss the legs with kitchen twine.
Roast the duck Place the duck on top of the raised rack and transfer it to the oven for  hours.
Remove the duck from the oven.
Using a sharp knife create a few shallow slits in the skin across the breast and around the thighs.
This will allow the fat to fully render.
Be careful not to cut the meat too much.
You just need â€“ slits all over the duck particularly around the fatty area of the legs and breasts.
Return the duck to the oven for  hour.
Remove the duck from the oven and let cool as you prepare the filling.
Prepare the filling Gather the minced ginger garlic scallions and Thai chili peppers in a bowl.
Add the hoisin sauce soy sauce orange juice and sweet chili sauce if you like.
Shred the duck Once the duck is cool enough to handle pick the meat from the bones.
Avoid any meat that feels very sinewy.
You can keep as much of the crispy skin as you like for the dumplings particularly the skin around the breasts thighs and legs.
I discard the skin on the back of the duck.
Reserve the carcass for stock if you like.
Place the meat and skin on a cutting board and finely dice.
Transfer to the bowl of aromatics and toss to combine.
Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.
Your filling is finished and youre ready to make dumplings Fold the dumplings First get a small bowl of water and place it on your workstation.
Place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the middle of the dumpling wrapper.
Wet the edges with water and fold the dumpling in half.
Pinch the edges to seal the dumpling closed into a halfmoon shape.
You can crimp and pinch the edges as you seal it but it takes practice Steam panfry or deep fry the dumplings To steam fill your steamer pot with water and place the rack on top.
Place a liner on top.
Bring the water to a boil and arrange the dumplings on top.
Reduce heat to medium cover and steam for  minutes.
To panfry Dip the bottoms of the dumplings into the water just to coat the bottom then dip into a bowl of sesame seeds to evenly coat the bottom.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over mediumhigh.
Add the dumplings sesame seed side down and cook without moving for  minute.
Pour in Â¼ cup water and cover immediately.
Cook for â€“ minutes.
Remove the lid and fry for an additional minute or so.
To deepfry Heat a few inches of oil in a large pot until the oil reaches ÂºF.
Add dumplings in batches and deepfry for â€“ minutes.
Transfer to a paper towellined plate.
To serve Make the sauce by whisking together the black vinegar chili oil sesame oil and sesame seeds.
Place the sauce in a small bowl in the middle of a serving platter.
Arrange the dumplings around the sauce and garnish with sliced scallions.
