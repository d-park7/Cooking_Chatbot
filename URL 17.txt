Interesting I guess It would be a much better dish and more like the traditional recipe if you reduce the amount of garnish increase the soup volume and use so ething other than tilapia I know it is environmentally friendly and all but theres a reason for it being at the very bottom of fish options in Asia.
permalink embed save report give award reply – hungryinThailand  S     points  points  points    days ago    child I wonder how not using tilapia will make it more traditional Any Thai person will tell you that tilapia is a great choice for steamed fish.
Additionally tilapia is all they sell in our traditional Thai village.
Any Thai person I know loves cooking with tilapia.
Steamed fish at a food market in rural tarket  tilapia.
permalink embed save parent report give award reply – superpurple    points  point  points    days ago    children Farmed barramundi or mullet.
Tilapia here always needs so much seasoning to cover up the muddy taste.

permalink embed save parent report give award reply – GhostDweller    points  point  points    day ago    children Alright i thought i recognized sellery leaf which isnt so nice to eat raw but on closer inspection it could be Parsley.
permalink embed save parent report give award reply – BHN    points  point  points    days ago    children Gotta hide the tilapia somehow 😜.
