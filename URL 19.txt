I NEED this in my belly.
Can anyone recommend a good curry paste for a noob not able to handle make my own yet permalink embed save parent report give award reply – ttrockwood    points  points  points    days ago    children Absolutely ONLY Maesri or May Ploy the yellow curry paste is mild red or green are crazy hot My whole foods actually sells maesri otherwise an asian or thai grocery or order online.
Keeps for maybe ever in the fridge Dont waste your money on regular grocery store brands thai kitchen is terrible permalink embed save parent report give award reply – anahatasanah    points  points  points    days ago *    children Yes Thats exactly what I mean.
Ive tried  kinds of thai kitchen and  types of trader joes they made me so so sad.
Im fortunate to know the bliss of real Thai.
It effortlessly swirls together bright savory delicate finishing with a touch of tempered sweetness.
🤤 It should not be earthy in a bad way akin to crud with dull and muted flavors that all blend together.
And heavy.
Always so so heavy.
🤢  The difference is so stark Thank you for chiming in I have a whole foods not  minutes from me and I have a couple asian markets to explore as well.
Happy makings permalink embed save parent report give award reply – ttrockwood    points  points  points    days ago    child Hit up the asian markets they will sell it cheaper.
Yeah once i had the right curry paste i home now i dont bother ordering in thai curry mine is just as good The asian market will also have good tofu and the fresh fun toppings like bean sprouts and cheap fresh herbs to add a combo of bail and cilantro is awesome permalink embed save parent report give award reply – anahatasanah    points  points  points    days ago    children Mmmmmm.
My mouth is watering.
I am SO excited to make this permalink embed save parent report give award reply – SuperPowers    points  point  points    days ago    children Where might someone who lives in a small southern town find this curry paste  Our grocery stores think having soy sauce and taco shells equals an international foods section.
permalink embed save parent report give award reply – ttrockwood    point  points  points    days ago    child Just order it online.
My favorite website maybe ever is called Weee they sell every japanese korean chinese and thai grocery item you could want at about the same cost as an asian market.
They ship dry goods about anywhere for fresh and frozen thats more limited.
Anyways they definitely have that curry paste and every other asian ingredient you want but cant find permalink embed save parent report give award reply – SuperPowers    point  points  points    days ago    children Thank you permalink embed save parent report give award reply – fabelhaftgurke    points  points  points    days ago    child I like Maesri it comes in a little can.
May also be labeled as karee curry paste instead of yellow.

Keep in mind its MUCH cheaper at Asian grocery stores in my experience.
permalink embed save parent report give award reply – ttrockwood    points  points  points    days ago    children Cubed firm tofu or even chickpeas make for a fantastic vegetarian option thats also a LOT cheaper i just use Better than Bullion veg broth and usually just canned coconut milk to keep overall fat and cal a bit lower permalink embed save parent report give award reply – HonkingOutDirtSnakes    points  point  points    days ago    children Sounds and looks great thanks for sharing.

Definitely try Pad Thai as well if thats not what you had.

I guess there is a great variety of them when some are probably bad and some are good.
A good recipe should tell you how to make the paste yourself you can buy if you are short on time permalink embed save report give award reply – PatrickGlowacki    points  point  points    days ago    children Hmm Im guess your right.
Like how baking recipes tell you to use sugar.
The recipe should give you clear instructions on how to grow your own sugar cane and process it.

permalink embed save report give award reply – mienczaczek  S     points  points  points    days ago    children There is no saffron 😃 permalink embed save parent report give award reply – MouthfeelEnthusiast    points  point  points    days ago    child Did you take this photo or is it from the recipe site permalink embed save parent report give award reply – mienczaczek  S     points  points  point    days ago    children Yes from my site permalink embed save parent report give award reply – Maestro    points  points  points    days ago    children Where and earth did you get saffron from They literally posted the recipe... permalink embed save parent report give award reply  MouthfeelEnthusiast   comment score below threshold  points  points  points    days ago    children Those reds stringy things on the top of the dish look like saffron.
After looking at the recipe Im not quite sure what they are.
permalink embed save parent report give award reply – Maestro    points  points  points    days ago    children It says thai red chili for garnish so its either super thinly sliced fresh chilis or its chili thread permalink embed save parent report give award reply – largececelia    points  points  points    days ago    child Look at the picture.
Its obviously saffron.
Thanks  uMouthfeelEnthusiast .
And jasmine rice balls For all the downvotes and hate no one is responding to that.
Sticky rice is a thing.
Jasmine rice is undoubtedly a thing.
"Jasmine rice balls" are not a thing.
Tell any Thai person youre going to mess with their Jasmine rice and they will ready the battle elephants for war.
