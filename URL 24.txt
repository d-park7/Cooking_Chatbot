So please dont use naan bread.
Its just garlic naan.
By the way those naans looks great.

Chickpea flour has a nutty flavor and is glutenfree which makes it an excellent alternative for those with gluten sensitivities or following a glutenfree diet.
However it lacks the gluten that gives wheat flour its elasticity and ability to rise so garlic naan bread made with chickpea flour may be denser and less fluffy.
Overall while chickpea flour can be used to make garlic naan bread it is important to keep in mind that the final result may not be the same as traditional garlic naan made with wheat flour.
