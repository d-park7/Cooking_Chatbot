The Barefoot Contessa just shared the weeknight  chicken  recipe of our dreams and we already wrote it on the menu this week.
In a video posted to Food Networks YouTube channel yesterday Garten walks audiences through how to make her delicious  Skillet Roasted Lemon Chicken .
It is so easy to make.
I love it Garten gushes in the video about this recipe.
She also explains When you cook the chicken it actually makes its own sauce with lemon and onions.
Its delicious.
We love a chicken that makes its own sauce Garten went on You dont even need to serve it on a platter.
I just take the entire skillet and put it on the buffet and everybody helps themselves.
It doesnt get better than that.
To make this recipe youll start with an herb oil made with thyme and other ingredients ground together.
Its mixed with olive oil to create an easy marinade for the chicken.
Ingredients for the chicken skillet include lemons garlic onions and more prepared on the skillet before putting the chicken on.
Its such a juicy flavorful recipe that can also be prepared in advance and kept in the fridge until youre ready to cook it.
This makes it perfect for when youre hosting a dinner party or just need a hearty meal during the week.
Picture coming home to this warm chicken dinner after a latenight practice instead of picking up fast food again.
