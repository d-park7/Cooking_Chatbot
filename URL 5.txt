This enticing smoked salmon toast accompanied by delicate softboiled eggs presents a delightful lively and showstopping dish thats effortlessly achievable for a Mothers Day brunch extravaganza.
My personal ace up the sleeve in this recipe is the homemade pea puree which imparts a burst of refreshing spring essence to every bite.
Ingredients  pc bread  tbsp pea puree  slices smoked salmon  pc large eggs  pc lemon zested  tbsp fresh peas optional a few sprigs of fresh dill a small bag of mixed greens extra virgin olive oil for garnish freshly cracked black pepper Maldon sea salt optional softened butter optional ​ Instructions Fill a small pot of water high enough to submerge two eggs completely.
Bring to a boil.
Once the water boils gently lift the eggs into the water using a spoon.
Set a timer for  minutes *see notes.
After the timer goes off drain the water and run the pan under cold water for  seconds to stop the eggs from cooking further.
Crack the eggs at the bottom and carefully peel the eggs.
Cut in quarters and season with sea salt and black pepper.
Pick out the most beautiful herbs and salad leaves from your salad mix.
Using your hands tear them into bitesized pieces.
Soak them in a bowl of cold water for  minutes and then allow them to dry on a paper towel.
Cook the fresh peas briefly in boiling salted water until tender.
Drain rinse quickly in cold water and reserve in a small bowl.
Cut the salmon into thinner pieces using scissors.
Toast the bread until crispy around the edges and butter both of them.
Spread a generous amount of the pea puree on the buttered toast.
Add the quartered eggs then wrap the smoked salmon pieces around the eggs.
Garnish with the lettuce herbs fresh peas a few cracks of black pepper a little zest of lemon rind using the Microplane Maldon salt and olive oil.
Notes If you have really sweet fresh peas you can serve them raw but quickcooking them is usually the better option.
If youre cooking eggs straight from your fridge then  minutes   seconds will be better.
For eggs stored at room temperature like here in Europe  minutes is perfect.
These times are for large eggs.
If you have smaller eggs then youll need to cut back on the cooking time.
