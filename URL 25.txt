×    Duck Breast with Mushrooms and Pearl Onions OC Poultry    i.redd.it  submitted   days ago  by  BushyEyes  comments share save hide report loading... all  comments sorted by  best top new controversial old random qa live beta Want to add to the discussion Post a comment Create an account – BushyEyes  S     points  points  points    days ago    children Recipe  more photos here originally   My Favorite Duck Breast Recipe A quick tip Typically you need to only boil pearl onions for  minutes.
I go a little longer to soften them a bit more so I dont have to sauté them quite as long since youre holding the duck.
BUT If you dont mind dirtying another skillet feel free to start those mushrooms and onions in a separate skillet as you cook the duck.
Seared duck breast  duck breast  pound Salt and pepper to taste Mushrooms and pearl onions  ounces gold or white pearl onions  ounces cremini mushrooms trimmed and thinly sliced  tablespoons reserved duck fat  sprigs thyme  garlic cloves peeled and thinly sliced  tablespoon freshly minced parsley plus more for garnish Salt and pepper to taste Sweet potato puree  sweet potatoes about  pound peeled and cubed  tablespoons butter ½ cup whole milk plus more if needed  tablespoons sour cream  teaspoons garlic powder  teaspoons Aleppo pepper flakes or paprika and a pinch of crushed red pepper Salt and pepper to taste Parboil and peel the pearl onions Bring a medium pot of water to a boil.
Add the pearl onions skins on and boil for  minutes.
Transfer the onions to a bowl of icecold water using a slotted spoon.
Once the onions are cool enough to handle carefully cut off the root end of the onion with sharp scissors.
Pop the onion out from its skin.
Continue on until all the onions are peeled.
Discard the skins.
Cook the sweet potatoes Dump out the water from the pot and add the sweet potatoes.
Cover with fresh water and bring to a boil.
Boil for  minutes until forktender.
Turn off the heat.
Pour the potatoes into a colander and return the pot to the same burner.
Allow the potatoes to dry off for  minute using the residual heat from the warm burner.
Add the butter milk sour cream garlic powder and pepper flakes to the potatoes.
Using an immersion blender blend until creamy and smooth adding more milk if needed.
Taste and season with salt pepper and garlic powder or pepper flakes.
Set aside and keep warm.
Cook the duck Pat the duck dry breast dry.
Using a sharp paring knife score the skin at an angle in ⅛inch increments until the skin has been completely scored from edge to edge.
Be careful not to pierce or cut into the flesh of the duck.
Place the duck skinside down into a skillet.
Turn the heat to medium and cook for  minutes or until the fat begins to render out.
Adjust the heat periodically as it cooks.
You want to stay somewhere between medium and mediumlow.
If your duck breast is unevenly fatty for example the ends may have a thicker fat layer than the middle of the breast use a small castiron press or skillet or a metal flipper to press that part of the duck into the skillet to encourage even browning.
After  minutes get the heat back to medium or just slightly above.
The fat in the skillet may begin bubbling and sputtering a bit more rapidly.
Check the skin and continue frying and adjusting the heat until the skin is deep golden brown and crisp.
This may take another – minutes.
Just keep adjusting the heat and peeking at the skin.
Flip the duck and turn the heat to medium.
Cook for  minutes or until desired internal temperature is met.
For mediumrare cook the duck to about ºF at the thickest part of the breast.
Note Do not take the temperature of the duck through the skin.
Pierce the flesh in order to get an accurate temperature read.
I prefer to cook the duck until it reaches ºF.
Transfer the duck to a plate and cover it tightly with foil.
Set aside to rest as you finish the rest of the recipe.
Fry the mushrooms and onions Drain all the duck fat into a heatproof jar through a small sieve.
Wipe out the skillet and place it on the stove over medium heat.
Once hot add the mushrooms and cook for  minutes until the mushrooms begin to sweat and take on a bit of color.
Add  tablespoons of reserved duck fat pearl onions and thyme sprigs.
Season with salt and pepper.
Cook over medium heat for  minutes until the pearl onions are forktender and golden around the edges.
Stir in the minced garlic and fresh parsley and sauté for  minute.
Turn off the heat.
To serve Right before serving remove the foil from the duck and slice it crosswise.
Spoon the sweet potatoes into a rimmed plate and pile on the mushrooms and onions.
Arrange a few slices of duck on each plate.
Garnish with more parsley and Aleppo pepper flakes if you like.
